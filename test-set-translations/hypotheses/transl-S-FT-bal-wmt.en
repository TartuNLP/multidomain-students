Four members of Kemerovo Grouping were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to Postimees, Slava Gulevich, the head of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in the underworld of Estonia, detained the police in the criminal world under the name Slava Kemerovski.
Gulevich detained in Spain was arrested with the permission of the court.
Yesterday, the court also arrested three suspects detained in Estonia.
Suspects are members of the so-called Crime Association aged 27-57 years of age, who mainly commit drug offences.
In Malaga Province, Mijas, Spain, the alleged leader of the criminal organisation, was detained.
Three men were detained in Estonia as a suspect, one of which has been collected according to the data collected by the leading figure of a criminal association and two are members of a criminal organisation.
The data collected indicates that tasks and roles were clearly split up in the criminal organisation.
The purpose of the criminal organisation's activities was to commit drug offences and thereby earn criminal income," commented Vahur Verte, Head of Pro-court proceedings in the criminal case, State Prosecutor General.
"We do not rule out the increase in the circle of suspects of the criminal case in question," the prosecutor added.
It is people who have previously been engaged in the interest of law enforcement authorities, and some of them have been punished for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation.
"The international cooperation has become common for us and its weekly operation shows the success of cooperation," commented the prosecutor's Verte.
Ago Leis, Head of the Central Criminal Police Department, said that nearly a year and a half years had been preceded by detention.
"The long-term work in the first half of the week was realised and held at the same time in Estonia and Spain, suspects of crimes," he said.
Leis added that the officials of the Central Criminal Police helped to detain Spain.
For years, we have had a good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and civil guards.
These detentions are yet another messages for criminals that we can reach them from the other end of Europe," Leis said.
The information gathered so far unequivocally points out that when the men who have been in doubt, may continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecutor's office requested their arrest and the court also approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is waiting for him to surrender to Estonia.
In the context of this criminal case, immovable property, vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation.
Pre-trial proceedings in the criminal case are conducted by the Bureau of Organised Crimes of the Central Criminal Police and heads the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of blackmail in 2005 and punished him with five years" imprisonment.
In the middle of the last decade, after the then underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the criminal world.
Gulevich from Kemerovo emerged in the underworld of Estonia in the early 1990s, when he began to deal with blackmail in Tallinn.
Supposedly, he taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at different hotels and demanded monthly roof tax from businessmen.
International joint operations, criminal-generated practices and judgments that the incumbent judgments confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the last judgments, eight accused from the criminal case of the so-called Dikayev criminal case, who were confiscated criminal proceeds of EUR 80,000, or a judgment on nine persons that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal organisation aimed at the illegal trade of secret cigarettes and the commission of crimes related to trafficking in trafficking in trafficking in salacitars in Ida-Viru County and South Estonia.
The amount of classified criminal income is nearly 71,500 euros.
In these criminal matters, success has been ensured that police officers exchange information and prosecutors with foreign colleagues on a daily basis and, if necessary, acts are carried out in any country of the European Union.
Civil rights group warns about travelling to Missouri
The Organisation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned dissuaded black people travelling to Missouri from state-discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The statement of the group states: "The NAACP travelnote issued for the state of the Ministry, which is valid until 28 August 2017, invites all African-American passengers, visitors and the masschildren to be particularly attentive and highly careful when moving throughout the state, taking into account all the dubious racial-based events that have taken place over the last time over the state and here."
According to the NAACP, the group encouraged a travel warning to be issued as a recent Missouri law, which makes it more difficult to win discrimination, and the fact that the targets of the state's law enforcement authorities are largely minorities in particular.
"People's civil rights are violated.
They are drawn at the edge of the road due to their skin color, beaten or killed," said Rod Chapel, President of the NAACP Missouri branch, to The Kansas City Star.
"We've never received so close complaints before."
This is the first such warning that the organization has issued about the state of the United States.
The group referred to events such as racist insults in the direction of black students in the head of a 28-year-old Tory Sanders from the University of Missouri and Tennessee.
Sanders died under six suspicious circumstances of the beginning of this year after he ran through the state, and the Missouri police arrested him without being accused of a crime.
In addition, the remark refers to a recent report prepared by the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that the state is suspended by the use of black drivers by 75% more likely than that of white people.
"The note is designed to make people aware and warn their families, friends and professional companions about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be ready, it would mean including bail money or informing relatives about the fact that they pass through the state."
Based on the latest data of the FBI hate crimes, 100 hate crimes were recorded in Missouri in 2015, which places the state in the 16th place in the country in the cross-section of the country in 2015.
The travel warning is also in response to a new Missouri law that makes it difficult to sue a company in search of housing or work for discrimination.
The American Liberties Union - ACLU had previously issued travel remarks about Texas and Arizona after these states passed immigration laws that obliged local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because, according to AC, it increases racial profiling.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs usually issues travel warnings about other countries, but recently interest groups have started using this measure as a counter-reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Hepatitis: what could everyone know about the different forms of this hard disease?
hepatitis tuberculosis, or inflammation of the liver, can be caused by five different hepatitis A, A, B, C, D, and E functions.
All of these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver.
The malignant disease, however, is chronic hepatitis B and C, which may progress in the development of liver cirrhosis, i.e. liver wrinkles and liver cancer.
The auditor's sufferers of acute hepatitis are similar to those of all types of liver - fever, fatigue, anorexia nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, gray stools, dark urination, muscle, joint pain and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
The last sign of disease also comes from the popular name of the inflammation of the liver.
ed Any unused product or resumption of breath is unknown.
It is only possible to identify different types of liver enzyme that can be determined on the basis of laboratory data.
Forex hepatitis can become chronic hepatitis and go on for decades without signs of disease, which means that a person may not know anything about a disease that affects their dangerous liver.
The Moon Kutsar highlights different types of hepatitis and describes their course for more detail.
A hepatitis viruses spread from sick people and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, sex, from infected people's stool to the hands and hands of food, surfaces, objects, mouths and the consumption of drugs.
Family members and caregivers of a patient in the A hepatitis, i.e. family members of the risk of illness, people with chronic liver diseases, people with an infected sex, men who have sex with men, drug addicts, passengers visiting A batter high spread.
Infection can be prevented by vaccination, in particular it is recommended that vaccinations lasting and be exposed to the risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands, wash all fruits and vegetables before drinking for food.
Hepatitis B viruses spread to the use of polluting substances (hambows, rascal agents) of a patient when they have had blood in contact, and foetoir disease, sex from a hepatitis, and femoral/cythinoma.

Although on the last round, the competitors tried to push the four-time Olympic winner off the track, 34-year-old Farah found strength on the end line and won in 26.49.51.
Farah didn't think for a long time, pulling husband Tania and children with her husband to the track after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
Being on the track was wonderful," Farah said to journalists.
Farah targets the fifth title competition in London in a row for the golden double of 5000 and 10,000-metre races.
Everything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "The Lady in gold. The extraordinary story of the portrait of Gustav Klimt's championship, Adele Bloch-Biauer's portrait of the art" will go much deeper than the birth story of a work of art in Vienna in the late and early 20th centuries.
But even more thoroughly in history.
It would have been useful for a well-eat-meaning amount of information, i.e. a harder cut in the hair, the narrower topic would have been allowed a portrait in the title to gain more influence.
At present, there were two books between some covers: Gustav Klimt and his painting "The Lady in Gold" Adele Bloch-Bauer's story and much more extensive and comprehensive history book for respected Jewish families and German occupation, together with its after-effects in Austria.
The first third of the book takes the cultural life in the middle of the bubbling Vienna and who himself ended up in the capital of Austria, can imagine how more than a hundred years ago life around Ringstra was or how all heads turned in Central Cafe when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of cultural figures was in one of the richest cities in Europe, and when you see the name familiar in the book, you feel more culturally.
At the same time, the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where the proliferation in an incurable guilt and was the highest level of suicide in Europe, as if more to develop, there is nothing more to be granted.
Or perhaps - every double-sex brush pull adds colours to the cultural life of the beginning of the 20th century in Vienna.
Dream of the trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews had grown exponentially in Vienna, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost one in tenteen people of Vienna had a Jew.
Adele's parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married the Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Blach and Klimt posed for his famous paintings, his father had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adelet's all the glamorous life he belonged did not pull.
If you look at "The Lady in Gold," it is difficult to believe that this grand lady was infected towards the end of his life and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order the portrait of his wife from Klimt, the last moment was the hottest painter in Vienna.
Klimt's order cost 4000 kroons at the time, a quarter of the price of a country house.
The fact that, in the case of a few portraits, the champion's love story with a model was suspected, no sugarmagnadi.
As far as Adelesse is that the relationship between the model and the artist's close relationship continued for the rest of his life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "The lady in gold.
The extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait," Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Immediately before the beginning of work with Adele, Klimt had been to Ravennas San Vitale basilish, and researchers think that the brilliant mosaics seen there, Emoty Theodoraas gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adele as a mosaic painted from Adele.
Klimt presented his "Lam Gold" in Vienna in 1908 and at about the same time (in 1907-1908) the golden painting "Suudus" was born.
Art historians did not fail to notice the similarity of the two women.
What about Hitler?
"I think that, as a reminder of my friend Klimt, I owe him to make his work of his hands available to the public," Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after the artist left (Klimt died in February 1918) to the Director of the Belvedere Museum and wanted their family Ktilim's collection to go to the museum.
Six years before his death, another portrait of Adele was made of Klimtil.
In his will of his will (the Adele left in February 1925), he asked her husband to leave his two portraits and four of Gustav Klimt's landscape paintings in the Austrian Gallery.
His jewellery he bequeathed to Maria and Luis.
A year after Klimt had completed "Austria Mona Lisa," 17-year-old Adolf Hitler had tried to enter the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, but failed the draw.
Although Hitler's later anti-Semitism is sometimes considered to be the fact that the Jewish professors did not accept him at the Academy, none of his examinations was actually Jewish.
In any case, Maria's mission to the Austrian Gallery referred to in 1939 had changed significantly - it had become important from the rich Jewish Jewish art bodies in Vienna to find the works of what they minded for the Nazi party.
Hitler's personal art assets were also matched by some of Adele's home works, but not those of Klimt.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery began a ten-year litigation between the Austrian government and the heirs of Bloch-Bauerite.
All you have to say here is that if "Suudlust" sees "Death" in Belvedere Castle in Vienna, then Adele Bloch-Baueri depicting "The Gold of Lady" must be seen at Neue Galerie in New York.
And before the Vienna race, read the above book.
Even if you don't go see Klimt's work, because at least my emotions revolved more Nazi and Jewish theme after the book was closed after the book was closed, the painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer, the painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer.
Thus, not so much a portrait, rather the story of fate of the family - and a very touching story.
The Earth's family tree brought away from the book at the beginning of the book was facilitated by a depravity.
A 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In elife swimming, Gold was very close to the personal record of his 200 m back swimming by swimming 2.16,62.
The top brand dates back to the 17-year-old beep a week ago, when he won the Canadian Junior Championship by 2.16,58, mediated by Priit Aavik Sjumisblog.
Gold made it last, i.e. the tenth-th-finals.
In the finals, he passed the distance with 2.15.76 and won a good seventh place with a new powerful top mark.
The Estonian record of Alina Kendzior (2.15,13) remained to separate Gold for a little over half a second.
In Estonia's all-time ranking, Gold rose third and his fresh personal top brand is the fifth result of Estonia's all-time.
The hope of the future is still taking off at the Canadian Adult Championships in 100 m, 200 m and 400 m in free swimming and 200 m and 400 m complex swimming.
Last week, the Canadian Junior Championships took place in Toronto and Gold also made successful start there.
He won a silver medal in 200 m free swimming with 2.03,22.
This distance was last swimming so quickly in 2008.
Elina Partõka, only the Estonian record label, has swim faster than Gold throughout the ages of Estonia.
The Estonian woman living in Canada also won a bronze medal in 100 m free swimming with a great personal record and with the top brand of the new Estonian season 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, a year older than him, has swim this distance only one century faster.
He received a letter of 1.03.69 in the opening exchange of the message swimming in a 100 m back swimming.
On half a longer distance, he only won the seventh place when he swam in the finals 2.17,31.
Gold is currently in charge of the Estonian season rankings on four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics sharpening teeth.
The time for holidays is here - that is also about relaxation for the President of the United States, Donald Trump.
However, since Trump has already been one of the most holidays of the President, critics are already sharpening their teeth.
According to U.S. Today and CNN, the President's plan to spend a 17-day holiday at a golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the President's holiday began yesterday, Trump's opponents have spoken a week on vacation.
They're gonna give Trump too frequent resting.
Namely, it is customary for the President to spend time on weekends in his villas in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
By the way, Trump has not rested the most during his 196 I.D. for his 196 I.
For example, George W. Bush was able to be on vacation for 67 days, while Barack Obama was half as much as Trump, only 21 days.
However, Trump tend to forget things quickly.
After becoming president, Trump said on "60 minutes" that there will be no time for long breaks during his term of office, as a lot needs to be done.
He also expressed his resentment over Barack Obama's holiday three years ago.
The current President wrote on Twitter at the time: "At a time when Obama is on vacation, golf plays, parties and jazz concerts go, ISIS cuts the heads of the heads from the end."
According to White House officials, a 17-day visit to the golf club is not exactly a relaxation.
It is officially called working leave, during which Trump has no time to read or other favourite activities.
In addition, there was also another reason on working leave.
Namely, the White House's Western wing air conditioning system will be replaced and therefore all the staff had to leave.
The Oval Office and other workspaces of the President are also located in the Western wing.
"I don't think anyone else would like to be in the Western wing in August if there's 38 degrees and there is no air conditioner," said Lindsay Walters, the spokesperson of the White House, who stressed that the President will continue to work during the holiday.
Where President Trump will spend the next 17 days, you get an idea of the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook - do not stand for government office if you do not tolerate the criticism of voters
The father of our country knew a lot about unfavorable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers did not take long to proclamate him for everything from internal politics to his political principles.
The criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he didn't make his critics silent.
Because in 1783 Washington said that "freedom could be deprived of us and more and in silence we could lead to massacres like sheep."
It brings me to the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan subordinates has blocked and deleted at least 450 people" posts who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And inwards the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union - ACLU was then sued.
The Governor's civil society stamped the action void and online commentaries are crawling with counter-reactions in the style "God?."
"It's just Facebook," many said.
But that's all about it.
And it counts especially much when it's a man like Hogan.
It is overwhelmingly popular Republican governor in a democratic state.
The percentage of his approval is the second best among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not an unthinkable piece of shit.
He has led the state on a firm hand and remained strictly firm on his principles.
In addition, he has used a fairly wrong Facebook as a key instrument in dealing with his constituents, for example, after chemotherapy, you have a lukewarm head for the first time after chemotherapy.
Thus, the governor's newspaper - which is a public forum with official labels, managed by staff receiving wages from taxpayers' dollars - blocking of people visiting people is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan's spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the behaviour of the governor in an interview with The Washington Post, arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it is too easy to paint a picture of online traffic signs, sparpenters or anger-filled people.
The Post spoke to several real people Hogan blocked.
And that's exactly what they are people who communicate with their chosen managers, the owner and pastor of the teacher, the owner and pastor of the teacher, not the Internet trolley.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not filthy.
Pastor quoted the Bible in his post, oppressing Hogan's Catholic.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Maryland Bowie did not incite anger, but about hate crimes.
"I politely that I am disappointed, as he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote The Post's news story in the commentary state.
"I also do not like the idea that how many people comment on the same topic, some immediately call it an indifferent collective effort instead of admitting that this is a large number of concerned citizens."
What the governor's official called a "directed junk protest" would probably call the others "open support."
The Facebook age allows easy to match messages, simply blocking a critic or erased a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than when, in the past, when workers had to be expelled in order to collect newspapers with critical editorials and burn them or arrest the protesters and force them to remain silent.
But exactly right now, it's just digital.
Hogan is not the first state official criticised for making Facebook and other social media channels toothless.
President Trump has sued Twitter users who have been blocked from Twitter's stream.
One of the first judgments of a significant significance was made last week in Virginia.
James C. Cacheris, U.S. District Judge, decided in Alexandria that the chairwoman of the county supervisory board of Loudoun violated the first amendment of the Constitution when he blocked the voter on his Facebook page.
In Kentucky, ACLU also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) for Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
During Washington, affordable postal costs had a similar effect on the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800 quarun the number of newspapers and anonymous writers were tricked his way of driving.
And even then Washington had to be in the chest with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to the newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making Washington's decisions.
According to historical documents collected under the online edit Washington mail collection project, he buried the Cabal under petitions that criticised his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Great Britain.
But he didn't make them quiet.
Freedom of expression, disagreement and debate are the foundations of our country.
And the right management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to comfort at Renaissance Club
The former European first number Ronan Rafferty hopes for the comfort of the home territories in the next three days, when the 25th Scottish Senior Open will take place on the East Lothiani Renaissance Club golf courses.
The Northern Irishman, who was on the archerfield Links trails in the neighborhood last round before Paul Eales was defeated before Paul Eales was defeated and performs the role of the tournament instead of Jerry Sarvadi, the founder and CEO of the club.

"I couldn't defend my Extremadura Open title because it was taken off my winning race after a year.
It's magic to come back on that.
It's a great place to play golf.
I remember memories of last year for me and for me, for me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory.
It was a very special time we always carry in the heart of it."
Gary Orr, who joined the European tour of mushrooms again on the surface of the homeland, also returns to the competition, halfway through the beginning of this year, when he received 50.
This is his first event in Scotland after participation in the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"The home to play is always a bit more meaningful," said Orr, Helensburgh's man.
"The desires to perform well, but at the same time you also feel the extra voltage.
I've enjoyed playing a lot again and shown a rather decent golf game.
I'm satisfied with the progress of things."
The Trio will join the former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and the champions of the mushroom tour Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty will join the Trio.
The Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of six Scots, the rest of them are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Poverty and death in a gold-filled country
When Bardina makes Dege's dinner, he doesn't use a stove.
He's rarely using the pot.
The Indonesian regent of the Tyre Province of Paiai, the regent of the city of Paiai, the capital of the capital of Paa, places the housewife on the fireplace directly on the fireplaced in the local language.
After half an hour, the coaled slack will be taken from fire and the skin is eagerly placed with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor - he does not have furniture - and there he also does his daily household chores, for example, washing with blurred water from the nearby swas.
The toilet role is performed by bucket in the roofless room.
Since he is the youngest of his wife's four wives, she is not destined to take care of any field.
Polygamy is common here.
However, a late-stage work can be dangerous - most of the men of the village are unemployed and many of them drink hard, in addition, there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to visit the village after five o'clock in the evening," he says.
This is a rare glimpse of life in Papua Mountains, a former Dutch colony, which was merged under Indonesia in 1969 after a referendum that created controversy, in which only 1026 elderly branches were forced to vote in front of the eye.
The movement of the Dutch to liberate from the underdom of supremacy towards the rapidly against the Jakarta government, which is still holding the area under its strong control, keeping away from foreign journalists and human rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Paapuaks and Western Spawn, so that the independent Papua New Guinea remained in the eastern part of the island.
Enarole is equally distant and abandoned, and to reach this, you have to fly from the capital of the province to Nabire for 90 minutes from the capital of the province and then pass a five-hour journey to the availator with a rental car.
There is no public transport.
A city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covering wave iron roofs, which have made rusts into yellow brown.
Very few Indians have taken a journey here, not to mention journalists, and there have been no foreigners at all.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, Mee Pago's papuay worshipped the god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing such clothes," says Degei, referring to handmade cockfish, dark blouse and bright skirt.
"Before this, we carried only plant leaves on the body."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line, and the statistics on infant mortality and illiteracy are one of the worst in Asia.
But it's also a gold-filled country in Indonesia.
Just 100 km from Pania, which is a mountainous province of 153 000 inhabitants of New Jersey, the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, which is part of Freeport McMoran, Phoenix, is located in the world.
In 2015, Freeport mined about USD 3.1 billion from here to gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can be proud of consumer wood supplies, which is estimated at USD 78 billion.
However, these wealthies are the source of the suffering of the papua, as they lead to the sunival presence of a powerful Indonesian army.
The New York Times report of 2005 showed that Freeport paid approximately USD 20 million to local soldiers and military units between 1998 and 2004, including USD 150,000 to one officer.
The attempts of hangers to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden decline and they are handling mercilessly.
According to human rights activists, more than 500 000 buffaes have been killed since 1969, and thousands of other Georgian army have raped, tortured and imprisoned.
According to the Asian Human Rights Committee, the mass killing of genocide in the highlands belonging to Papuaua tribes was the measure of genocide.
Last year alone, more than 3,900 peaceful protesters arrested the Indonesian police in the region.
The 2016 report "We're all of us" contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (according to one's second report, rape and electric shocks are particularly common) and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims, because there are such incidents every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Kruvid has been turned even stronger, as Papua's natural resources have caused the new settlers from elsewhere from Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians, but demography is changing, as Muslims from the popular Jaava, the islands of Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawes arrive on economic migration.
The squirrel's family food stations sell a crispy and mixed cork-gado, served with peanut sauce.
The locals can't compete with them.
"The rules began to sell chicken and vegetables on the traditional market from local papua," explains the 24-year-old Abeth You, born in Pania, who moved to Jayapur, the capital of the province, in order to work.
"Pinant people's peats - the peat mama-ma's [naised] - therefore lose its market share."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, who is known among the people as Jokowi, promised to deal with these inequalities and human rights violations in Papuaua in his 2014 election campaign.
The former woodensmith was defeated on his way to Jakarta's presidential palace 27 of 29 constituencies, including Paniai.
But Papua has changed very little, and the locals feel disappointed.
"Our hearts are broken, because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in anticipation that he fulfils our hopes in the restoration of justice," You says.
In fact, Paniai was suffering from a low two months after Jokowi took office in October.
On 7 December 2014, 11 children sang at the fire at the fire by the Christmas song, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle on a motorcycle.
The children who were in contact with those who had them to turn on the front lights.
According to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was on their voice tone and later returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, drunken soldiers chased their children and beat them with the handles of their guns.
Then one of the soldiers shot among the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby election commission building was set on fire and the next day, things erupted even more.
Approximately 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and military control centre to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting hats and presented the wait-tantsu of Paw honey, during which a bird song was drunk and imitated.
Some protesters started throwing stones at the police and military.
In the exacerbation of the Pahamee, a order was sent to the soldiers through the internal radio. "If the crowd points more than three times the resistance, they will shoot them down," according to an official document, they were told, which had been seen in the magazine TIME magazine, but which have not been issued to local media outlets.
Yeremias Kayame (56), the elder of Kego Koto district of Enarotal, Sentence to maintain peace, asking the crowd to go home.
No one had the will to listen.
"Returned, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist," he told the magazine TIME in his bright colours on the minnta of the tree house.
Kayame still doesn't know who was the shooter, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered.
"There was a lot of fire, there were a lot of shots," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times by his cousin who witnessed the shooting.
"I went to him and studied his body through to make sure he was with him," said Yohanes gloomyly to the magazine TIME, who uses only one name like many Indians.
"I saw he's dead... kissed him."
The Chief Inspector of Papua Police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that he was subject to back only to the security of his precinct because it was attacked.
"We need to protect ourselves if we are threatened to kill," said Pudjo Sulistyo Sulistyo, spokesperson for Papua, Police spokesperson in 2015.
"This is a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and were a lot of injured.
The news about the killings reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi Jayapura had a passionate speech, where he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the abuses in Papuaua.
"I want to solve this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would have taken an out-of-court mechanism to resolve human rights crimes.
But almost immediately followed the apologies.
"Most crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and in the early 2000s.
The thing is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes," he said.
However, when talking about TIME magazine TIME on 5 June, Wiranto recalled his words, saying that he had no intention of creating a mechanism to deal with complaints in Papuaua.
Instead, he said that "all will be solved by law."
Wiranto, accused of crimes against human rights against human rights, in connection with the death of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the 1999 bloody independence referendum, said that 11 crimes against human rights had already been solved in Papuaua, including those in Pania.
The families of the victims of Paniai adopted such claims with a grim mistrust.
"I have been interrogated four times over the last three years, but there has been no progress," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I fear the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the people of Pania are afraid to dissect this incident.
He said he got beaten from the army after he helped bury four victims.
"After buried the bodies, the army came to look for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police fired villagers at the Pania neighbouring tracing in Deiya.
One person was killed and 17 was wounded, including children, when he became warfare between the villagers and the head of the construction company, who refused to transport an unconscious man to the hospital.
This man, a 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested at the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers stoned the villagers with stones on which the latter responded with warning shots.
But according to the locals, the mobile brigade (Indone Military Police) began to shoot at the people, killing one person.
"We were in a big panic, we fear vengeance," said Dominggu Badii, 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the injured from the entry.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiya Parliament has called for the prosecution of police officers involved and the removal of the police mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a problem for the government of Indonesia.
The lack of thought-bred development feeds the discontent of the discontent of the tribes of honey, dani and the damali living in the degrading centre hill of Paaua.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL) - the rebel army, which, according to him, protects the rights of limestones, organising occasional attacks and kidnapping attacks and kidnapping agents among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the leaders of VPL come from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, the army has arrested Paniai in recent years on the pretext of 'promoting the sovereignty of the state' and arbitrarily detained thousands of people.
Some of them never show up again.
Among the people of the papua, the Panias are known as "the tragedy of forgotten."
Poverty feeds discontent.
The little rice sold in Enaroali is too expensive for the purchase of locals.
The bread is in the same inaccessible.
People grow their whole food themselves - mainly in the batat, in addition to some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Farming is a work of women, each of whom can maintain four or five batter fields.
They usually keep the majority of the harvests for the family, the rest are selling on the local market.
Ten bars only cost 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have increased between the outskirts and new migrants who have arrived in a large number of since the opening of new routes at Nabire airport.
The few jobs that exist go better to educated and more prosperous migrants.
Papua themselves often lack capital or the necessary skills to pursue a competitive business.
"Your people are not interested in staying, because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Paniai tribes.
The separation keeps the world's eyes away from Paaptop.
In addition, foreign media have strict restrictions.
From the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, as "they did not follow relevant practices," although they had been given a rare filming permit.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Head of the Asian Department of Human Rights Watch, the restrictions on transparency and development have not been implemented to eliminate the restrictions on transparency and development.
"The new threats to reject visas and a blacklist of journalists trying to make reports in Papuasia in Indonesia," he said in the statement.
The lack of a caged eye of the press means that international pressure on the government of Indonesia is largely limited to its close neighbours.
In March, six Pacific countries were dung by Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "multi-ubture crimes" in Papua, including the shooting of Paniai.
The same countries have historically supported the VPL.
Arrmanatha Nasir, spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, excluded the accusations of the group, saying to journalists: "Indonesia still has democratic order and freedom of the press, so that it would be difficult to bury the evidence of cases against human rights.'
Local people want more foreign governments to be observed.
If the Dutch official delegation, led by the country's human rights ambassador Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapurat on 4 May, local people interrupted, but according to the source who wanted to remain anonymous, urged: "We want freedom."
New presidential elections will take place in Indonesia in 2019, but the papua does not believe that they will vote back for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man with good intentions, but the people surrounded by him who are involved in the shooting of Paniai," says Hobai, Chairman of the Council of tribes.
He wants to make it clear to Jokowi that, in addition to the fact that the people of Pania are constantly living under the threat of a predatory army, they are suffering from misery due to lobster education and health services.
According to Goba, the people of Pania, like other crews, consider their voice to Jokowi as a debt that he has to pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite the abundances and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai went to the last symbolic counterhas - they buried the body of one of the victims on the police station and the land opposite the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be put on a game, at least they prevent those responsible from forgetting their crimes.
"One of our family members were killed," says Yacobus with the head you dropped.
"What else can we do?"
The fire swallowed Dubai Torch's skyscraper for the second time.
On Friday, he swooped through one of the world's largest experience towers in Dubai, forcing hundreds of inhabitants from this 337 metres high and 79-storey buildings.
This is the second fire that has only lasted a two-year-old man who has just been devastated, called Torch, i.e. Tõrvik Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct causes of fire were presented.
"We slept and woke up at the fire alarm and the touch of people.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes from the 50th floor to decline," said Reuters a resident who called himself George.
According to Dubai civil protection officials, firefighters extinguished the flame at about 4 o'clock in the morning at the local time, according to the local time, and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to the victims to ensure shelter.
This incident may once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the external surface of high buildings around the world.
During the investigation, following the fire of the Tower Board of the 2015, it was found that the most damage was suffered from facade - decorative panels and insulation of the external surface.
The British police have said that they believe that the Bluetongue and facade panels of the Grenfell Tower in London may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire that worked there in June, in which about 80 people died.
See: These phones will probably receive sales hits in the autumn
Spring and autumn is a sweet time for technical fans, because then phone manufacturers will publish their new top models.
In the spring, Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium were sold, and new hit phone phones are expected to be on the shelves in the autumn.
According to Kristjan Seema, Marketing and Sales Director of Tele2, this year's flagship well is characterised by innovative design, an ocular scanner, a screen with a resolution of 4K on edge and a high-speed processor.
The Samsung Galaxy S8 technology world caused great excitement, which has also reached the front of the Estonian smartphone sales ranking.
In autumn, smart enthusiasts allow even more agile fast charging, a more durable battery, a higher quality camera and greater water and dust resistance.
He added that according to rumors, assumptions can already be made and four top models can be predicted, which will probably conquer this year's sales tables.
These four top models of smartphones will still reach the supermarkets in the autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach the stores already in mid-September.
You hear about what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it, there's a lot of rumors.
While iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences next to iPhone 6, Apple's tenth birthday is expected to be different from the previous ones.
There's talk of four colors: black, white, pink gold and chrom.
One of the elements of the new design is probably a screen that covers the entire front panel of the phone, the home button has been lost and the fingerprint reader is built in the screen.
Apple's design manager JonyIve demands that the new iPhone model look like a smooth glass.
There has also been talk of the ceramic version of iPhone.
In addition to the eye-isseller, wireless charging and even more high-quality camera, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
It's definitely one year of better smartphones.
The pre-order of the brand new Galaxy Note 8 starts on August 23.
There have been many rumors of what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
I hear that even more business user is designed, and S Pen allows even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one of which is a wide range and the other teleport with a narrower field of vision.
Right now, no one knows what the two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung's first test, which is definitely comparable to iPhone 8 in terms of quality.
However, we look forward to August 23rd.
Although Nokia has brought up three smartphones this year, led by Nokia 6, is still missing their flagship - Nokia 8, which will be presented already on 16 August.
We expect a screen from the 1.3 wench edges and the ultra-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a more durable battery from the edge.
Nokia is also talking about aluminium corps and a significant level of water and dust resistance IP68.
Like Samsung, Nokia's new model has two rear cameras that are produced by Zeiss, the optics of which are produced.
If Sony's sure flagship has so far been XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that in the near future, at least two smartphones will be added, with even more innovative functions.
We look forward to a smartphone, which is a bit more modest than XZ Premium, but with at least as good or better.
For Sony's new model, it has been speculated that its display is at least six-inch.
What reality brings us will be able to see soon, because, traditionally, Sony has published its autumn flagship on the International Technology Fair IFA, which will take place on September 1-2 to September this year.
According to the transcriticals leaking phone calls, Trump pressed Mexico on paying for the border wall
The Washington Post unveiled the phone calls translators between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and the leaders of the country in Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, Trump went to a phone call to the President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, that the latter would stop a public statement that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States chartered the wall for the public condemnation of the wall, saying, "You must not say it to the press."
Trump set up his presidential campaign's promise to build a wall of the south of the United States and swore that it would make Mexico pay for this project.
TransChristians were also published from his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which reveals a tense exchange of ideas.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take on themselves from refugees to Australia is "naked," "bright" and "rual." He claimed that the agreement that was made during the Obama's government would give a "small" impression because he had proposed a ban on dissetting of refugees to the United States.
Trump ended the call, declaring Turnbull that "there was the most unpleasant speech of the day."
The Supreme Court did not discuss the complaint of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid in the case where the city of Tartu rejected their bid for the procurement of bus line transport from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a directive rejecting the offer of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid in Tartu bus procurement, as the offer did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, Head of the Tartu City Government Civil Service.
It is a public bus service procurement for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029 within the city of Tartu.
The MRP City Lines complained to the Supreme Court judgment of Tartu District Court.
The Supreme Court did not accept this.
Although on social media, many complain that the noise from the Weekend festival disturbs their night hours and the whole city is full of drunk parties, there are also many who do not have any bad words about the festival on the beach.
I am even positively surprised that there were festives in the store so polite!
I didn't see any blur, no freak.
I even saw the out," says Laine in Persian.
"It's nice to come, be and enjoyed from Pärnu, which has remained winter like hibernation," he adds joyfully.
The yellowy Laine sleep from the beach does not disturb.
While living in the city centre, he used to hear music on the beach, now the music hasn't reached his home walls yet.
"But I hope I hear," he says happily.
Agnes, who also spoke to Õhtuleht, says that the big festival is rather good for Pärnu - it also contributes a lot to the turnover of local merchants.
In addition, he rejoices that so many Estonians have come to the village in the summer capital.
You don't bother the neighbor's baby.
Although I'm not sunbaking on the beach, but it's nice that the beach has revived.
And it's nice that the people are moving and it's been so three times," she says.
The first time I think it was a little worse.
"Then there were complaints," he contemplates.
However, he said that the mellus on the beach is common for the mainlands.
"This Weekend is a very good promo for our small town," says Harri, who is bathing in the park.
Melu and action have not beaten his rhythm of life.
But as a misja?!
We should all stick together.
Think about how it would be better interethnic communication.
A man of the black music is not crushed.
It doesn't bother, even though I live right there.
"Good people can save and there's no trouble," he says.
According to him, the guests who have come to Pärnu are polite.
"With the girls, of course, they have also a bit exaggerated, but young people are young and master god - don't let them go, but let people and we can handle!" he says.
The residents by the beach have travelled somewhere away by then, either to relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival affects life positively - people like this kind of booze," says Tiina, who walked with children in Pärnu.
His family's sleep does not disturb festival music either, although last year it came even further than this year.
Last summer, the stage was the other way around, then we heard more.
We live out of the city that we actually hear there well on the Pärnu River," he says.

NATO's statement said that five soldiers and interpreters were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident of Qarasacap district.

EPA annulled the decision to postpone the Sacterling Regulation after the actions
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S.) annulled the decision to delay the introduction of a Obama-era regulation obliging States to limit the causes of decommissioning emissions, one day after 15 States sued the Agency as a result of this passage.
EPA announced the decision to continue the 'institution procedures for the 2015 albeit', in late Wednesday, saying that this would demonstrate the Agency's commitment to cooperation with States States.
"We believe that we need to engage in dialogue with our partners and listen to them," said Scott Pruitt, Head of EPA, in a statement.
The Pruitt had announced in June EPA's intention to postpone the determination of ozone levels to measure congener in different parts of the country in order to determine where this level should be reduced by one year to October 2018.
15 mainly democratic states brought an action with the Columbia district on Tuesday, saying that this decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has tried to retrieve a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama. Trump says it is part of a more comprehensive plan for boosting economic growth.
But these aspirations have caused counter-reactions among democrats and nature conservation groups, who are concerned about the increased impact of the pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that ozone-inhalation of ozone-containing "may reduce lung performance and increase the risk of getting sick from respiratory diseases," such as asthma.
German pigs can have a party.
Germany's pigs and cattle may have a party, as heavy rains threaten the second largest wheat producer in the European Union, writes Bloomberg.
This year it may be that weeks of saku attacks before harvest may mean that the fruits intended for the bread industry are only suitable for animals for feed.
"The quality of the fever is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015," said Bernhard Chilla, analyst of Agravis Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 per cent of German wheat may be for animal feed, which is double compared to the usual one, Agravis predicted.
German farmers, like their European colleagues, have been exposed to any weather this year.
First, winter was too dry.
Then there was a cold spring, which was replaced by a heat wave in June.
In July, Germany was hit by rain attacks, which have continued in August.
Many eyes are turned to northern Germany, where the rain is obstructing harvest.
So far, only five percent of wheat have been harvested.
Most of the harvest has not yet begun in the area, the local harvester announced in Ceravis.
"The day is quite complicated days," said Frank Deckert, Senior Trader at Ceravis, from Rendsburg.
The clever swings of interior design of Finns in the most conveloping, i.e.
Beautiful nature plays its share in the interiors of the Messiah home, as through large windows, the great views of the shores of Saimaa reach many (live) rooms.
Every step of the way, the attempts by our northern neighbours to create both the crisp and the perfect (energy) homes are beginning to be noticed at all times.
The ability of Finns to use is worthwhile to be metuate and adhered to as building and finishing material, furniture and beauty.
Violent techniques and smart solutions can be found in fair houses as a builder and (home) designer.
It comes out vividly that the combinations of black, white and grey shadow walls, if they are complementary to wood tones and ghost plants, can be very spirited.
Good ideas can be picked up for a week, as the fair will last until 13 August.
Accessories and herbs suggest that this kitchen is often cooked.
The night against today, the Weekend Festival Baltic was underlined at this year's Weekend Festival, and Martin Garrix did his utmost to remember as the last speaker.
The crowd was really in the turn of Garrix - they were sung, dismantled, danced self-forgettingly danced.
When Garrix ended up, the joint mass was scattered from Pärnu beach to the city.
We bring you a gallery with all the pictures we caught our photographer in Weekend in three days.
I'm sure you're one of them, look for yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to face up to 66.7 kg of the most attracting glass of the nearby future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were separate rooms in the ESPN office in Los Angeles, with the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked to the other end of the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization sulweight champion.
After the victory of Garcia's unanimous decision over the former four-time World Champion Adrien Broner on Saturday, both fighters belong to the top five of the weighting rankings.
Garcia handed his right hand and said, "How are you going, champion?
I wish you luck.
Lomachenko protects his belts with Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 19 ESPN.
When a couple posed for photos, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas noted that there would be a "full measurement" between the possible confrontation between the fighters.
"I'm a closeweight," Garcia recalled.
"I uploaded to [63.5 kg] for the Broner, but I am not that big.
I'm 63.5 kg per small.
I want to move down light weight.
And he has to move upward weight [61,2 kg] and then we can fight.
Fans have asked for it.
Let us offer them that.
Lomachenko agreed.
"The world needs this fight."
In Kilimas, the question of whether it should be paid to look at it, which is part of his strategy that he wants to let Lomachenko debut in the 61.2 kg of class at the end of this year in order to make a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) for next summer, who is also interested in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell's match after their December of the Lightweight Forumrai on the 23rd September.
"To view this fight could be paid, as fans have wanted this confrontation," Garcia said, saying later that he is open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
"We are the main players.
No other name can attract so much attention.
Whenever they're ready..."
Garcia said he had to call Lomachenko a "powerful fighter" and could go to see his match on Saturday.
Lomachenko, on the other hand, was modest in praise of Garcia, saying that he thought the master of three divisions from Riverside looked out "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted it knocked out."
According to Garcia, the goal was to show the impact strength and then boxed.
Both confirmed that they feel how the tension grows to fight gangs.
"This is a fight that awaits realization.
No other confrontation causes so much attention and buzz.
I am more than ready to work for this," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best fighters, and Mikey is exactly the one.
It's gonna be a good fight."
Which corners of the world are moved to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) was recordly extended and issued more than 13,000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work, study or family.
If, for example, last year it was decided to issue a temporary residence permit to 6702 aliens, but in the tuna bubble, this number was 4928.
The authorities cannot say how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia, but such an analysis will be prepared in the Ministry of the Interior.
When nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year ten years ago, in recent years this number will reach 2000.
The number of applicants for residence permits increased exponentially during the Ukrainian crisis - in 2014 1087 people received a temporary residence permit, 675 a year earlier.
According to Statistics Estonia, the largest number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia is increasing - 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia last year more than left.
"The Ukrainian community has always been great in Estonia and due to difficult circumstances, it is natural that the opportunities for work and learning are sought from a country where the community and many already in front of the family are already facing," said Kristin Rammus, spokesperson for the Ministry of the Interior.
Last year and tuna bubbles had received a temporary residence permit, even more than the number of Ukrainians, even in the number of Russian citizens, although in ten years the total of the total number of temporary living licences has been issued in ten years.
If the Ukrainians come here mostly to work, then Russian citizens for the brunette.
"Considering the historic Russian community here, they are likely to have the largest family ties with people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, migratory research at the Estonian Academy of Security Sciences.
"If you look where Russian citizens who have received a residence permit have moved to live, then after Harju County, Ida-Viru County is right after Harju County," he added and pointed out that about 40 per cent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Last year, 1696 Russian citizens received a temporary residence permit, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wished to extend the residence permit decreased instead.
"The problem is due to the fact that instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for permanently to enter Estonia," explained Rammus, spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained rather stable for years.
In order to settle permanently in Estonia, foreigners who have lived here for at least three years can apply for the previous year.
Its aim is to encourage the survival of adapted people.
However, the long-term resident's residence permit, for example, for five years, requires a residence permit.
The extension of the old residence permit has probably decreased since the new residence permit.
For example, last year, 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years were granted a residence permit.
Now the Ukrainians can exchange work and the Estonian state is no longer fingering up as to whether the salary criterion has been met.
This residence permit was popular - the holders of a grey passport (1029), the Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36) were also eligible for applicants last year.
In total, 1968 people received a residence permit for the purpose of taking up in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In ten years, Nigeria has received a country whose citizens are one of the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
When, in 2007 three residence permits were issued to the Nigerians, then 200 last year.
Nigeria comes to study at the local universities.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular, for example, among Georgians, Chinese and Turks.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen mostly thanks to mobility.
They also have the rule that where the community has emerged in advance, there will be more easy for others," Rammus added.
For ten years, two people have also moved to Estonia, for example, North Korea, just as many from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 South Korea, 40 Indonesian and four from Uruguay.
If about 6,000 third-country citizens receive a residence permit per year, then this is about 0.46 per cent of the total population.
Even if you think more citizens of the European Union, migration will remain at about a percentage," Maasing commented that figures are actually small.
According to Statistics Estonia, 14,822 people travelled to Estonia last year, but 13 792 out of this.
This means that immigration exceeded emigration for the second year.
Most of the fields and indisers are Estonian citizens, but there are more of them among the leavers.
Therefore, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was in the minus with 2,000 people last year.
Estonians travel mainly between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture's princess smotees with sats, embroidery and quarrel
However, the Nordic conceptal ceiling has history for Maria Tammeoru - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream for hours somewhere in the museum and admire old sleeves and collars.
If you do something with passion, you'll learn and learn more about it every day.
This is the joy of discovery!
The glamorous world of Mammu Couture can seem to some strangers, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide how much shine is in your life!
I have a friend who has all the sauna full of my work couture dresses.
Because it's not his fault that he doesn't live in Hollywood and doesn't go on a red carpet every day, he wants to wear those beautiful dresses and wear them!
You can live your own life special!
Fashion artist does not recognize the gap between bright events and the grey agile day.
This is precisely the reasoning that led the high fashion to take the high fashion to rural areas, forests and fields in Estonia, to people who often do not reach fashion.
The Mammu collection was presented, for example, in Võru, Jõhvi and Pärnu fashion stage, where the royal definese filled the whole street with 45 models.
In Tallinn, the post is often taken in, they nod their sniff, but elsewhere there are more emotions - colloquials, get up, want to thank you by hand.
A large part of the audience came to look at, but now they're Mamu Couture fans.
If you exceed people's expectations, they'll be delighted!
And I like the feeling that I'm on a summer tour with my own fashion.
In Pärnu, we had a 50-metre-long red carpet, full of beautiful dresses full of dreams, it seemed that they would not have an end!
Maria also does not admit that the work must be presented to a supersa supermodel, he is happy to bring ordinary women to the stage.
I often invite our clients to the stage - they've always come with joy.
It's such a fun experience, you can shine on stage in a wonderful dress!
I'm so sorry I've never seen my show, I'm always behind the stage to give the last touch to the hopeless perfectist.
My nerve wouldn't allow to watch the hall.
Maria is the kind of fashion designer who not only wants to play a role in representation, but to be in everything way.
I have my sewing machine in the studio, most of the collection I do.
I like the whole process where you play with the details, discover.
I've never been far from my work, and I'm not afraid of work.
It is not limited to the design, including stylists, logistics, organisation, organisation - everything has to fit into the day of a familiar woman.
The staff will still have these hours of work.
I can't tell you when my working day ends, it's just a day full of joy!
I am still very lucky - it is like an incessant chain of happiness: I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and in turn compliments.
It has been said how many times it has magic in my dresses - they make themselves feel like a princess.
The abundantly nasty satsi series that made Maria's talent famous overnight was Mammu Couture's signature to this day.
Martin Müürsepp from U18 boys: The weapon of the Estonian subgroup tournament was now turned against us
Sorry, the fairy tale ran out.
The first thing left was that we couldn't get our desk.
And if there is such a big difference in on the table, there is nothing to do," commented Martin Müürsepp, the only basketball player who played to Great Britain, the only basketball player who played in the NBA, BC Kalev/Cramo.
The opponents took 28 balls from the attack table and received so much more attacks as a result.
We weren't ready for their aggressive defence or attack, it created.
Many English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we could not build the defense.
In the defense, however, they could keep their hands everywhere, we couldn't combine.
It knocked the crew down.
The homework of opponents was done better.
In the opinion of the mason, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to take down the momentum of their opponents.
Last quarter - we had a zero mistake, but the opponents have already received several quick baskets.
Attentiveness and close handling, which was our weapon at the subgroup tournament, now turned all against us.
Today we had no strength against their aggression.
The mason was satisfied with his ward in Kalev, Matthias Tass.
In general, good words about the whole team can be said, until today a single punch fist was.
It's a pity that they were already popped up with such an aggressive opponent before.
The cup has always been confident and played out today, but it seemed that he was tired - he had carried quite a lot of burden.
But he made a few beautiful movements that I've seen in practice before," added the tutor.
Horrible numbers: the girls' basketball team scored less than 10 points in the EM tournament in three quarters...
The U18 age group does not only go to the B-division Basketball Tournament of young men in Tallinn, the girls started the day before yesterday in Dublin.
Unfortunately, the Estonian game with Poland was squashed in the field of anti-repetitions.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter was 9:49, i.e. only in the last ten minutes the opponents took their feet from the accelerator pedal and the time was tied 16:16.
Both in the first and second quarters, Estonia scored 4 points, the third 1 point...
At the beginning, the Estonians hit two of the first four throws at first two minutes, but on pass 25 past the game, then one three-year-old in, and then 21 shots...
Perhaps in almost half an hour, 47 shots were captured.
In addition, 2 points came from four free throws.
There was a reasonable number of ball losses during this time, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland's hit was 33 per cent and Estonia had 13 per cent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses, on the opening day, the superiority of Portugal had to be recognised at 83:56.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to replenish stocks
Today, NATO's 1st permanent mine defence group arrived in Tallinn for the weekend to undergo a planned port visit to replenish the stocks of ships and preparing for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships make preparations for returning to the sea and give crew members the opportunity to a couple of days' holiday.
After the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters in order to carry out a number of exercises and be ready for future operations to search for historical explosives.
"The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and the co-operation training they carried out in local waters illustrates our integration with the allied forces," said Major-Asj Arto Reinmaa, Head of Operation and Planning Department, the Commander of the Operation and Planning Department at the Navy Fleet.
As of 29 June, NATO's 1st permanent mine defence group will be led by the Latvian Navy, captain leitnant Gvido Laudups, who took the tasks of the cross-group commander from the Estonian Naval Officer from the Estonian Naval Officer, Captain Johan-Elias Seljamaa.
The group's flagship is designated as the Latvian Navy supporter LVNS Virsaitis, which also operates the group manager.
In this half, the Estonian Navy mine hunter also includes the Estonian Navy mine hunter.
One of the four ships under NATO's maritime command is NATO's 1st permanent mine eradication group is a community service unit that can be sent to different places in the world within five days.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of the Pirita Monastery will once again become a place where Birgitta Festival, which was revived by the Maestro Eri Klas 13 years ago, will be held.
According to Risto Joosti (36), the artistic director of Tallinn Philharmonic, Risto Joosti (36), will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: The classical "Traviata" and "Tosca," the ballet performances of the enchanting "Bolerost" "Karlssonin" will also be no addition to the performance of the programme, which is Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratorium "Aastaajas" by the same international creative team, who in 2015 brought Pirita to the second Masters of Haydn's stage.
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre productions.
This is bigger than any musical theatre in its usual form.
It's a festival whose snowfall takes over and never let go of it again.
Because the experience the listener receives in this sublime and mysterious environment makes human souls ring and touches human perceptions in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you're the artistic director of Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't the Maels like the shoes look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, it's been a lot of help.
He directed me through my entire student career and also supported at the beginning of a conducting career.
Perhaps it is because of me to continue his work.
Eri Klas has injected so much goodness on the Birgitta Festival team and, of course, it's all transferred to me.
It was a great job to join a team who knows exactly how things work.
It was Eri Klas's great heart that gave me strength to move forward with the Birgitta Festival in Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am now, and I can do it!
What could give the audience at this year's festival, what you're offering special?
As a surprise, we have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, by the way, the first ballet written for Astrid Lindgren's story will be presented.
That's "Karlsson flies."
And one of the crezy nuances is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed his wish to write this work.
He's probably already a character of Karlsson, who has been living in his soul since the child.
Risto, how do you give it all this?
Thanks to my partner.
Such work needs a support system and a lot of love, and fortunately I have a heap.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions do not depend as much of other people, as of myself, i.e. how I am going to meet each new day.
And keeping such a conscious tone, keeping positivity and actually smiling to yourself in the mirror in the morning, significantly raised my percentage of happiness.
Especially now this week, when the most important attempts are, I have practiced it especially and it works.
Smooth of smiling activates the brain and raises tone.
It's not just a word.
I think people still don't know half the things about their body that the universe offers them, but everyone gradually discovers it.
Right now, it's a big moment.
Do you have a ritual before you step off the conductor?
It is always, clothes must be replaced for more comfortable.
It's a little moment for yourself.
But in general, I don't have a chance to rest before the big performance or make a little nap.
In fact, I even like to communicate with people actively, even before joining the conductor's remote.
But come all to Birgitta Festival, here's what to discover not a particularly big friend of the opera and ballet!
Watch the funny video with Risto Joost!
New results of the Swedish asylum seekers' age assessment tests were published
In Sweden, a test was carried out among asylum seekers, during which their age was assessed medically medically with a novel approach, and the latest results of the test show that more than 80 per cent of the Testitute was assessed older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute forensic Medicine (Rättsmedsohtut) started the tests towards the beginning of this year.
The tests were set up for more accurate assessment of age in the course of asylum application after the Swedish Miningverket was criticised for having not correctly appointed the age of several allegedly minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases to testing, and the Institute for Forensic Medicine has issued the results of 2481 tests between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) was estimated to be 18 years of age or older, and in 25 other cases the Institute of Judicial Medicine assessed that the test "may be 18 years old or older."
In 432 cases it was concluded that the person was "at least 18."
Tests are only used if the age of a person is under question.
According to Johan Göransson, working at the Institute of Forensonic Medicine, the results are consistent compared to those of previous months.
"We do not see a major difference compared to the statistics of previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he said to The Local newspaper.
The fact that a large part of the cases were judged out as 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
In May 581, the Institute issued the results of the test and said that in 442 cases, "there are references to the fact that the person being studied is 18 years old or older."
But when Svenska Dagbladet studied the results of these 581 tests, it turned out that in 243 the person had claimed directly that he would receive 18th this year.
This medical age assessment method, during which X-rays and knee joints MRT are made of the teeth of wisdom, after which dentists and radiologists are allowed to analyse them, have been criticised in some districts.
One of the scepticians is sceptic Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, whose duties include an assessment of the biological maturity of people to find out whether they passed through the usual puberty sooner or later.
"I have had reason to think about it and I do not think that the current method of measurement should be used.
Determination of the biological age in this way is highly uncertain.
If we cannot say for sure, we should not pretend we can," he said to the Metro newspaper.
But Johan Göransson, from the Institute of Forensic Medicine, defended the accuracy of the tests: "It can be said that the risk of breaking up the child into an unreleevably adult is low.
The biggest, perhaps about 10%, is a risk if a person is a little under 18."

20-year-old hammer thrower Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut at the London World Cup, gaining 18th place with 67.37.
The organ was the youngest female hammer thrower of the World Cup, and the joyful woman confirmed that he hoped to fight for medals in the future.

According to Forbes, the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and the coal business inherited him from his father.
It's about USD 1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee (RNC) published a statement on Thursday evening that "the change of the Minister's party is another blow to a democratic party that would prevent the country from being better again than to work for it."
"The 15 governor's seats and control over the lowest number of states in history - the announcement of Governor Justice is simply the most recent rejection of the party, which is led from the end of the end and is unable to find a positive and connecting message," said Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of RNC, in a statement to CBS News.

Coe praised the Russians' honest apology for the doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the international leader of the Athletics, praised according to him, "Russia's honest apology on Thursday" because of the doping scandal, but it repeated that now is not the time to allow for sports to return to the country.
Dmitry Shylakhkein, the hero of the Russian athletics, said at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that the ban on the competition imposed by his country is correct and he has a strong goal of fighting for doping.
He apologized to "all athletes from whom gold and silver medals have been scarce in the competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of leaving the competition ban imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of the state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think this was a very honest answer today, a very honest presentation," said Coe, President of IAAF, to journalists.
"The Health Council and the whole congress were satisfied that the Russian Sub-Union admitted itself that they had quite difficult times and they would do everything possible to reorganise the Sub-Union."
According to Coe, he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for restoration.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and there is progress, but Congress supports the working group's proposal that this is not the right time to withdraw Russia," Coe said.
"We need to do everything possible in the next few months to normalize the situation.
We have always proceeded from the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from the damaged system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict criteria of IAAF will compete at the World Athletics Championships in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, Head of the IAAF Working Group, said on Monday that Russia did not yet meet several criteria for restoration.
Following the presentation to the IAAF Council, he told journalists in London that the doping check is still inadequate and that the coaches who have been banned are still functioning freely.
The revolution of electric cars significantly changes the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only does the revolution of electric cars change significantly from the fuel market to infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers on the metal market.
Although mining guides like Glencore can say that from one place they win and lose another, it won't help smaller mining companies.
At present, Glencore earns from coal and oil, but in the future, the demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel is increasing in the future.
This year, the decisions of the United Kingdom, France and Norway have raised contributions to the spread of electric cars, which will allow the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades.
That's why Volvo has already known that they are planning to abandon the combustion engine, and Tesla launches a cheaper Model 3 electric car.
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, more electric cars are sold over two decades than cars producing from oil fuel.
"In some metals, this changes everything," said Simona Gambranini Bloomberg, raw material analyst at Capital Economics.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, the demand of which has grown for years.
There are about three times more copper in electric cars than in a regular car, Glencore reported.
Exane BNP Paribas estimates that this will increase copper by about five per cent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electricity cars results in additional lithium, cobalt, graphite and mangane demand.
Glencore will become a growing trend of electric cars from the copper price increase and the fact that he is the world's largest cobalt manufacturer, was predicted by the Jefferies Group.
According to this brokerage company, the winners of the race of electric cars are Freeport-McMoroan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market reacts to the already changing trend.
This year, 70 per cent have increased the cobal on the London Metal Exchange.
Last year's price increase was 37 per cent.
Copper has also increased by 14 per cent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore's share rose by 20 percent in London, having crossed the price rise to Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American.
On the losing side, there are lead-making companies such as Recyclex and Campine, who have to adapt to the new era.
Lead's main end use is the batteries supplying the electric drive of petrol and diesel cars.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk of lead demand unless it is found another purpose to overcome the fall in demand," said Michael Widmer, Analyst Manager of the metal market in Bank of America.
In the form of the price movement, there is not yet an open trend notice.
Lead has increased by 17 per cent this year, with the best metal from the price increase in prices in London.
Investors see problems only far for metal in the future.
"I am not sure that it is so bad for lead, because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars in competition," said Herwig Schmidt, Sales Manager of the Wibal Chechen Triland Metals.
When the lead demand falls, it will be slow.
Maybe it's gonna happen in about ten years.
In the meantime, however, stricter emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars, which depend on advanced lead batteries when launching frequent engines, is assessed by an international research organisation for lead and zinc.
Light metals like aluminium replace steel, as a lighter car can drive less electrically driven further.
This explains an additional 1.6 million tonnes of aluminary demand already between 2013 and 2016.
This represents 2.7 per cent of total aluminium production in the world.
This trend is about getting worse, said Widmer.
Aluminium has increased by 13 per cent this year, as the growing demand by car manufacturers has led to market deficits.
Steel producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding works with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce miracle-light car tracks.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe also attempt to develop a lighter melty of steel to resist the alumin.
"The strong steel should be the answer to this development," said Sylvain Brunet, analyst of Exane BNP Paribas.
Some successes in Europe are seen.
The end of the oil age can also lead to suffering as a platinum.
Last year, about half of this precious metal diesel-powered cars took the catalysts, Johnson Matthey, a metal refiner, announced.
"Many currently raw materials with high demand, such as oil and platinum, there may not be much demand in the future," said Bernard Dahdah, raw material analyst of Natixis.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole are becoming less important, but their importance will change within 15 years.
Platinum producers believe in the continued demand for diesel hybrids.
Uncore leader Marc Grynberg said that in 2025 more hybrid cars continue to be sold from full electric cars.
The great hope of the 10-year period of the plastics manufacturers is on cars based on hydrogen-based cars that depend on hydrogen power produced from hydrogen.
So far, however, this technology has not yet justified itself commercially.
"Diis seems to have a clear loser on the road to electric cars," said Exane BNP from Paribas.
German car manufacturers received a major setback in July, as Stuttgart's court prohibiting the use of diesel in the Mercedes-Benz and Porsche hometown.
How football financial rules affect the transition of Neymar to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unbridled spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from the world record transition from the Spanish football club Paris-Saint Germain to the French club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences from UEFA, the governing body, which prevails the European game and which is in power to ban the teams from participating in the prestige Champions League tournament, Paris Saint-Germain is waiting for Paris Saint-Germain.
The financial rules for fair play imposed by UEFA in 2011 mean that the PSG must prove at some point in time that Neymar's transfer was financed without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilians out of his contract, and Neymar's salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's transition to the French club.
The PSG is undoubtedly able to pay Neymar and add to its lettersful lineup, given that the team is financed by the Qatar's energy rich family.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of spending on recruiting players, but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that enable them to come out in the football business with their own.
Michel Platin was founded on the FFP after being elected President of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that fall into great debt in the search for success are actually dealing with cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners should abandon support.
Since 2011, FFP will focus on monitoring their losses instead of the debts of the clubs.
This change means that the business model Roman Abramovich first used in Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and then make a major cost to improve the team and create a global brand - is more difficult to implement.
During the current three-year assessment period of FFP, which lasts until 2018, clubs may suffer losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platin was shamelessly rejected in 2015 from the office of President, Aleksander Ceferin, his successor of UEFA, is still committed to obstructing excessive spending.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules in the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is a follow-up at UEFA, a follow-uper at UEFA.
Although PSG paid Neymar as a single full payment for the repurchase clause, they will be able to distribute this amount for accounting purposes into lots of the entire contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, which is why it is possible to show a transitional fee in the next five years as an amount of EUR 44.4 million.
In the case of the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the PSG and Abu Dhabi and the most severe punishments were punished on his neck.
The PSG was fined 60 million (at present USD 82 million), which was later reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was required to limit the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to revise over regulatory financial institutions, blowing up their income through companies related to the owners of the club.
The company of Qatar may sponsor the PSG, but if the value of sponsorship is considered to be overexploited by the market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be taken into account as an official income.
This happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of Qatar Tourism Authority's PSG support was overwhelmed.
It has been said that a certain part of Neymar's PSG service may come through the payments of the 2022 World Championships Management Committee from Qatar.
However, the PSG and Katar 2022 deny that Neymar could become an envelopy of the World Cup, and claim that the UEFA regulators would be able to easily reveal such a manoeuvre.
The penalties previously assigned to the PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in connection with any attempt to ignore the rules.
The people familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed Neymar's transition with the PSG.
They spoke to The Associated Press, provided that their anonymity is guaranteed, as they are not allowed to discuss the situation of the PSG.
The latest published reports show that PSG earned a profit of more than EUR 10 million in the 2015-2016 season with a turnover of approximately EUR 542.4 million.
Data from the last financial year has not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymar's arrival will be well affected by sponsorship transactions, freighting and shirt sales.
The club expects an increase of at least 30 per cent in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly upset about the departure of one of the biggest football stars, attempted to prevent Neymar from switching, claiming that PSG was violating the FFP.
"This is a clear case of "monetary doping" with the club and the country," said Javier Tebas, President of La Liga, to the Spanish newspaper AS, PSG mainly owned by Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares La Liga's attitude that the state is funding the club.
"This is the result of ownership and it has completely changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the state, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of the fair game, as the state may have other ways or other interests to represent such a large player in the country."

Today 50 years ago: a storm of hurricane measure in Estonia, which ripped roofs and windows from the houses.
The hurricane, which raged on 6 and 7 August, caused major damage to Läänemaa, Harju County and Raplamaa.
In northwest Estonia, the speed of the wind was over 30 m/s during these days.
My old man ran from a curved tree in the garden to another and the touch with his hands to support them.
Everything was dark and raging like the end of the world.
At the background, roofs already flew from the houses, recalled in 2002 the old lady Linda Kurova from Haapsalu in an interview with Estonian Nature magazine.
Linda's husband saw how the garden planted with his planted collapse.
But what do you support trees with your hands, where do you get against such a storm?
The sea came under the window, the water sprayed in the window," said Mrs Linda, who lived on Kalda Street in Haapsalu at the time.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the perch of the platform of the railway station had flown 20-30 metres, Linda saw most of the chimpanbikes similarly only the next morning.
According to the locals, behind Paralepa, the tree was down in the guinea pig, some completely down, some in half.
Everyone looked very depressing, the storm went through a beautiful old trees with a rag and a pragina like a war.
Lääne-Viru County could not suffer particularly severely from the August 1967 storm compared to Western Estonia, but the damage was also large there, wrote Virumaa Teataja in 2007.
Haapsalu Castle Park and Padise Park were wiped off the earth, but the parks of our area were also severely damaged.
In Tallinn, the speed of the wind was measured up to 35 meters per second, i.e. about 130 kilometres per hour.
On Merivälja in Tallinn, there was a small girl crying in the 6th hole: "Mom, Mother!
The chickens are in the air and can no longer be left?" wrote Virumaa Teataja.
Põlli Manor building in Viljandi County was destroyed so much during the storm that it was decided to demolish later.
The constructions of Türi ski jump hill, which were no longer restored, were not held on August editorial board.
The Red Star newspaper wrote on 12 August 1967 that the harvesting of cities and settlements is slowly progressing slowly, and the residents could participate in cleaning.
The storm was also greatly affected by crop fields, and the newspaper announced that "the original organisations must be a innovator and directional in order as well as infertility and direction in harvesting."
Hurricanees can be discussed if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record of the outbreak wind in Estonia remains from 2 November 1969, when Ruhnu was measured to be 48 m/s.
On the island of vaindloo, the measuring instrument broke, so the measured strong wind could not accurately register the speed of the strong wind measured there.
The secret of pure beaches: night cleaning and poor beach weather
Cold summer weather also means smaller cleaning on the beaches of Tallinn.
"If there is no weather, people are on the beach, and if it's not, there are no people," says the beach cleaner.
The echoes on the Stroomi beach of Northern Tallinn.
They are offered melodic a tractor that ploughs on low reverse, which ploughs the stripe on the plaasie.
In fact, the last sifts from a depth of seven centimetres through the sand, picking out sea cabbage and a deleted of people: bottle caps, cigarette bones and more.
People are still coming to the beach, whether water is warm or not.
When it's beautiful weather, people are on the beach, and if there's no," says Alexander Usov, the head of the beach cleaning work of the private limited company," says Alexander Usov, Head of the beach cleaning work of the private limited company.
It's 6:30 and there's a bitter cleaning job on the beach, because there's gonna be a lot for people at 8 o'clock.
Usov's on work tomorrow.
After Stroomi, he also keeps an eye on the beach of Pirita, Lake Harku, Kakumäe and Paljasaar.
The garbage levels have decreased.
Years ago, there was a lot more of it.
People are now already able to assess what is being done for them," says Usov, who has been cleaning the beaches for 15 years.
It was the case that when something new was set up, it was already broken the next day.
Now they're being holding what's on the beach.
Clear beach price
One of the biggest works on Estonian beaches is the cleaning of sea rubbish washed on the shore, i.e. the adre.
For example, on Pirita beach, it has to be transported 400 000 tons on the beach season.
"This is an incredible amount," Usov notes.
The second large category is the household waste, i.e. everything that people leave behind.
On a half-kilometre Stroomi beach strip there are eight large garbage containers that need to be emptied three times a week.
So much garbage is generated.
However, colder summer weather has meant that the trash is one fifth less than otherwise.
The third species are abandoned things.
Mostly, they're kids.
As a harvest this time, Usov has shoved out a dozen models cars from the sand.
They will wait for owners on the wood tea leading to the beach.
"Typically, they come out more, but it's a normal harvest." Usov already knows that soon he will find them back inside the sand.
Children come to the beach and take toys to drown them again in the sand.
The garbage is scattered
Erika Scholler, a representative of Haabersti administrative services, admits that the screening work of the tractor is disrupted by locals.
The noise that lasts from the hours of the night to the morning interferes with the sleep of people living in the neighbourhood.
However, this work is impossible during the day.
One in six must be sifted through twice.
"If we do this, the district will fine us," Scholler notes.
However, the goal is to get Stroomi beach under the international blue whistle mark, similar to Pirita, Pikakar and Pärnu.
"Compared to Europe, there is much more work in Estonia to ensure that the beaches are maintained," Scholler says.
We have more treasures and stones and harder to sift the sand.
However, our beaches have less waste than elsewhere in Europe.
When he hears that Martin, who lives near Stroomi Beach, Martin, who lives near Stroomi Beach, will unforceally take part, highlighting the current bottlenecks on the beach.
In the mornings, there's a disgusting picture everywhere.
The problem is with birds and bottlers who have pulled garbage bags in the face," says Martin.
Although it is difficult to assume that people can change their behavioural habits so far, Martin hopes that the city government will do something about trash cans and, for example, puts them on the covers in order to at least prevent birds from being familiar with there.
In general, however, Martin is satisfied with the development of Stroomi Beach.
We can see the city takes care of it.
With children's fields, enlightened and fresh asphalted roads, it has become more pleasant.
It was once that the roller skates could only drive on one road," Martin notes.
Potatoes of the treasure survey in Stroomi: coins, coins only
The 40-year-old Dimitri has come to use the morning tide, who combes the beach edge with metal detector as treasure hunter.
He does not believe that he will find anything pricelist today or in the future.
Sea gods are not generous enough for this.
"I have been dealing with this for a year and have not found anything valuable so far," Dmitri says.
As a hocrafter, Dmitri is a treasure bag with some euro coins, bottle caps and dangerous pounds that later throws into the trash can.
Usually there are coins.
"There are no rings, rings and more like this," says treasure hunter.
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25%
Bank of England expects to have a notification that interest rates remain at the same level as the energy-inflicted economic growth and inflation affliction have softened speculation in relation to the increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth remains sluggish, as households' incomes have put interest rates on hold.
The policymakers of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted in favour of holding 6:2 rates in favour of 0.25%, and fewer members demand an increase this month, as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut the 2017 growth forecast on 1.7% and its 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the pressure on households' incomes would still be expected to increase by 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the bank also signalled that the increase in rates would be necessary to curb inflation due to Brexit in the next few years, and the financial markets may need a higher increase than expected for loan costs.
Members also voted in favour of the partial re-imposed revolt package in the market for the economic renunciation of the economy, which was launched a year ago.
In February, the bank will end the deadline financing scheme offering banks cheap funding, although he said that this scheme is now expected to provide GBP 15 billion, which is GBP 115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision taken in the decision taken in the relationship, the bank says: "The average forecast of theMPC will be reached in the near future, as the difficult situation of actual income in households will continue to have an impact on consumption."
For the purposes of this Regulation, it was reiterated that there is a need to "a slight tightening of finance policy" and the "somely larger" level as expected in the markets.
The stock exchange is currently forecasting a first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any jumps are gradual and limited.
The bank's reduced growth forecasts for this and next year will be comparable to 1.9% and 1.7% in May forecasts.
The forecast of growth of 1.8 per cent in 2018 remained.
After that news, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell to USD 0.1sum and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures, which have quenched increasing in the second quarter, rose from 0.3% to 0.3% in the second quarter of the previous three months.
The bank says that the growth will probably remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it will start to gain a little momentum.
The bank's latest inflation report gave little reason to welcome the rising inflation and miserable wage rises to the affected households, saying that the situation would get even worse before the recovery.
It was added that monetary policy could not prevent a loss of income in the next few years, but a noticeable recovery of wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Due to the weak nail, the growing demand for British production is also encouraged by the growing demand for British production, which partly compensates for lower consumer costs.
The decision will come a year after the rates were taken by 0.25% in August after the shocking EU referendum, which caused a sudden weakening of the nail.
According to the Bank, it is likely to take four years to completely blow up prices and the economy in life.
Before the last decision of the bank, there was a growing demand for increasing the rate, as inflation had increased pressure on households; in July three policy-makers demanded 0.5% of the rate.
Inflation fell by 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although, according to the bank, it was expected and in the coming months there will be a rise again.
The bank said that the excessive increase compared to the 2% target was completely due to a weak nail.
Andrew Montlake, Head of Coreco mortgage brokers, said: "According to the recent decline in the exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market will once again become more competitive, as lenders' snapths work and hope to bring out a positive year.
The stock exchange seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions will come to an end, as refinancing, often without a service fee and a low rate, has become more and more popular."
NHS is a HIV drug that caused a conflict of 10,000 people
Since September, the patient has access to the "transformative" prevention treatment of HIV following a battle in the Supreme Court on whether NHS should finance the medicine.
NHS England announced that national health will now make estimated 10 000 persons available to 10 000 persons for the initial clinical trial, a tablet that is to be administered before the intercourse and which has shown a loss of infection by around 86% for high-risk people.
NHS agreed to finance a clinical attempt after the appeal court supported last year's decision of the Supreme Court, according to which NHS is able to pay for PrEP, despite the Authority's own assertion that the medicine should be financed instead by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, CEO of NHS England, welcomed this journey published on Thursday as a "new extensive intervention," while the national AIDSfond (NAT) described it as a "returned spot."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register people. In October, the clinics will be added before the programme is introduced everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre- exposure prophylaxis with Pr creature is a shed of HIV drugs that are taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of getting infections in the blood.
Results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV among people at risk of infection.
Taking a PrEP before intercourse means that there are sufficient certain medicines to prevent HIV infection in a person's body.
Such medicines can be taken every day or no later than two hours before the intercourse.
The candidates suitable for treatment include homosexual or bisexual men, transgender people and people with partners infected with HIV and do not receive treatment.
Clinical clinicalcities detect suitable people who agree to participate in the clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV-edgeous partner cannot receive antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also receive their desire to participate in the local sexual health clinic participating in the programme.
The programme costs GBP 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to get medicinal products this week after the international tender procedure.
The purpose of the clinical test is to assess the actual potential of PrEP, collecting clinical evidence of who is intended for whom the drug is intended and how it is consumed and applied in a large picture.
Stevens said: "This new large-scale intervention should complement and amplify the struggle against the widespread and increasingly successful HIV spread.
This is another milestone in the fight against one of the greatest health problems of mankind in more than three decades' years."
Deborah Gold, CEO of NAT, said, "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
MEP, if it is properly targeted at those who need it and belong to the risk group, offers the possibility of changing the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people with high HIV risk in England have access to a powerful new tool, which is individually managed and independent of the negotiations with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "Now it is a priority to ensure that the clinical test is delayed quickly over the country and that no HIV risk group is excluded.
Now that the PrEP clinical test drug has been obtained, we are on the way to protect more than 10,000 people who are at risk of being infected with HIV.
Sharon Hodgson, shadow Minister of Public Health, said: "The beginning of the clinic of the PerEP is very welcome and deeply delayed after months of delays and squandering the government's legs.
Evidence will indicate how major changes this medicine can lead to an end to the spread of HIV prevention and life-changing infection.
This clinical test takes us one step closer to a full understanding of the advantages of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical test is introduced as soon as possible in order to protect people who have contact with HIV and to take us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
The price of electricity increased by 12% in Estonia, but fell in Latvia and Lithuania.
In July, the difference between the stock exchange price for Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to 1.94 euros in July, compared to 7.71 euros in June this year, Elering said.
The main reason for the price difference is the failures of the Lithuanian-Swedish connection.
In Estonia, the average stock exchange price of electricity last month was 34.33 euros per megawatt-hour and the price increased by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price decreased by five per cent to 36.2 euros from megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was 34.17 euros and the system price of the electricity exchange Nord Pool was 26.37 euros per megawatt-hour.
Prices increased by 12 and seven per cent, respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, electricity moved 75 per cent from the hours of last month towards Estonia and 16 per cent of Estonians from Estonia.
The remaining nine per cent of the classes did not take place between the two countries next day.
Electricity moved between Estonia and Latvia from 99 per cent of the time to Latvia from Estonia and 73 per cent of the hours had the total transmission capacity in use.
According to transactions on the Nasdaq OMX market in July, the market price of electricity on the Nasdaq OMX market may be about 34 euros and 37 in September from 30th and September.
The price of carbon dioxide influencing electricity production price increased last month and transactions took place at a price of between EUR 5,04 and EUR 5,47 per tonne.
Highlife living - half floors and smart design tips have made this little Earls Court apartment a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker, a passionate real estate innkeeper, changed her great Knightsbridge's home in 2014 for Earls Court's apartment.
It is located on the ground floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne has not packed his bags and sold the apartment has been tribute to the new design.
"Because I lived with his former partner on a much larger surface," Joanne said.
"I was doing something that would be equivalent to the price I offered.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it, and made an offer the same day."
Since the first visit, this 93-square-metre apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
At first, it was an apartment with one bedroom and a complex placement - to reach the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half-floor to take advantage of high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
These were my demands," he said.
He hired Erfan from the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed operating at Duck & Shed, who operates at Notting Hill, to take advantage of 3.8 m high ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two rooms to each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a semi-couple where you could stand up.
Erfan had to approach the matter creatively.
"The man-made structure is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to reorganise the premises so that they are located on top of each other without being bowed.
It wasn't just the construction of the platform, but used steel structure, so that the height of both the upper and lower space is right."
This position made it possible for Erfan to create two full-time rooms with a lot of dramatic elements.
The half-storey opens a warm-time copper light to a glamorous dwelling below view.
Frequency surface gold furniture, silver details and retro-scentered Serge Mouille light emphasize the style of the room.
Use of mirrors plays a role in adding theory, space and brightness.
Both ends of the short corridor are added to the mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the rear wall with a mirror gives the impression of a window opening to another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet offers a deposit to all Joanne cuts and glass containers.
The living room adds the opportunity to close the kitchen part if it is not used, creating a imagination of a glamorous room.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
However, the peculiar fact that it is a garage type-lifting door is a unique thing in this kitchen.
"It went a bit of a design coat," explains Erfan's steel-strong veneered MDF door.
"It has a counterweight, which makes it very easily sliding forwardingly if it pushed up."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 extra square metres, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"After all, the floor area is what you sell - or what gives value to real estate," says Erfan.
"The wall estate agent will take place in the room in outdated form and make calculations based on the area of the floor."
Here they have managed to increase the floor space, while using high-quality materials that add luxurious to space.
"The landlords are what you touch and which thereby help to create an emotional connection with your home," Erfan says.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical cable in the wall.
It's important, but you don't make the tongues of the heart.
This shows that good design and increased area help to do something amazing from a fairly normal apartment.
In fact, they might want to not leave, as happened to Joanne.
Dane Jensen, the chief character, is a Chicago skyscraper, competing with his colleague for a promotion.
Does not read any amount other than earned money next to which any ethics is forgotten.
The man only sees his wife and three children early in the morning and late in the evening.
In the first half of the film, I will see myself from the idea that it is a version of the business world of "Kaardimaja" - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's speecher is similar.
The further the film, the less framed element, but remains, and the moral intention of filmmakers begins to appear more and more.
The most variable experience becomes cancer for the protagonist to suffer from the son.
Now you have to make a choice between work and family life.
The son of the architect's office makes the father think about the big buildings of Chicago on walks with really important things such as faith, goodness, love..., without touching even the disaster of twin towers.
After the third scene, where the son opens his eyes, there is a feeling that the filmmakers have certainly followed the goal of getting the audience to cry, because even the viewer with the even most glittered hearts cannot hold back tears in the sense of the suffering of a cute cancer-sected boy.
When his son falls into a coma and his situation seems hopeless, his father will once and for all understand his work from morality and do the work of the good deed to the old man looking for good deed.
Now I bet with myself in my mind - if the film has the happy one, I reward my perceptiveness after the film with coffee, but if I am wrong, the screenwriter can commend for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there's a suspicion that I'm gonna lose coffee - when her husband calls Dane from the hospital and the man rushes towards the hallway in slow motion.
However, the Son has actually healed wonderfully, and although his father has lost his job, it also turns out to be positive, because now there is time to deal with the family.
I can also feel good - I can predict the end of American drama already quite well!
To tell you the truth, the film is well constructed, all the necessary elements are available.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and moral is beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I guess that's gonna bring this movie in.
Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the President's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
Then he'd be the first.
Politico writes that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news, in the hope that it would keep the boss in a more covet.
Here's a break-off reporter from Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with high officials on her first working day, she brought out a key problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he planned to solve bad information to reach the President's hands.
Kelly told the officials that the information had to be carried through him, either on paper or at meetings, because the President would make better decisions than she would share good information."
Kelly's diagnosis seems to be logical, but others have tried it, and they have failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with television dates back decades, and even now that he is in the White House, his TV speculation habits have not disappeared.
"When the candidate Trump was upset about the unfaithful media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was also reflected honestly in the publications influential," said former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg to Politico in February.
Politico Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "The former campaign worker of the month's former campaign worker says Trump's option of managing Twitter habits if to ensure that his personal media consumption also contains a steadily fun song."
All right, all right.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habits have ever been "checked," is ridiculous.
Perhaps those campaigners know something the rest of us don't know - that Trump's tweets would have been even more ignited without these interventions.
We'll probably never know about the tweets that Trump didn't post.
If his assistants could save him a few times from the trouble, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to prevent Trump from creating controversy consistently.
Some of the problem is that in the White House, who are competing with each other, people are attempting to promote their own interests exclusively, transmitting material to Trump that supports their worldviews, but may not always be credible.
Politico, reflecting the course of the whole story, wrote a tendency of advisors to feed the President with strategically questionable information.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
"Current and former Trump's subordinates say that Trump can react to a negative press, with particular damaging effect on information leaks, explosion-sided by obsessing the identification of their source of origin.
This also happened at the end of February, when someone shamefully copied a copy of the online provocator to Charles C. Johnson's GotNews.com website, which accused Katie Walshi, Deputy Chief of Staff, of the White House "source of information" of the White House."
It doesn't matter that Johnson's been permanently blocked from Twitter because of mocking, or that he did not offer any specific evidence or that he has filed false accusations and withdrawn them in the past.
Trump read the article and started asking about Walsh under the subordinates."
Goldmacher added that Reince Priebus, Chief of Staff at the time, and Rob Porter, Head of the White House Office, "have tried to establish a system for the management and documentation of documents reaching Trump."
How did that work?
Kelly's trying to do exactly the same three months later.
Perhaps he turns out to be a more efficient leader than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad do not allow to get the opportunity to perform.
There is a lot of foreigners to heritage in the centre of Tallinn.
The people with whom Õhtuleht learned that they would play in the Old Town without permission from the city government.
The first we found three street musicians near Viru gates, who had taken as many dogs with him.
It was clear that musicians with raterial pillows and broken clothes were backpackeds, for whom one shower mast would take off.
Despite the appearance, the only woman in the company played a fun trial on the accordion, while one man was songlet with three balls and called closer by him.
The third man was sitting next to them on a backpack and smoked his own twisted plam in peace of mind.
These three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the people passing.
Bob, who played an accordion with Noem and the balls, said that they were music on the streets for both fun and money.
The purpose of the membership performance was to collect the ticket money on a ship travelling to Finland on the same day.
On the question of whether they asked for permission from the city for music in the Old Town, you shake the head of Nom and Bob.
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we will never stay in one city for more than a day or a couple, and most of the time allowed for a month or something.
There's no point in paying for that," Bob explained.
When we got back at Viru Gates about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were at musicians and drive them away.
The society moved with back bags and dogs to touch happiness at the intersection of Viru Centre.
On Viru Street, three Polish young men also performed, one of whom played a violin, the other clarinet, and the third was even led by an electronic piano.
"We are here to offer people entertainment to spread music and joy, and in order to make money for fuel and living," Mivosh explained the trio pianist.
According to Mivosh, they are aware that the city government's permission must be the licence for the performance.
"Naturally, we don't have it," he said jokingly.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there is no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we're going elsewhere, but we have to try," he added.
Eesti Pank bought bonds of 149 million euros in the framework of the public sector asset purchase programme of the euro area central banks in July, and the central bank bond portfolio increased to 4.36 billion euros.
The central bank does not disclose more detailed information about purchases.
Hardo Hansson, President of the Estonian Bank, has previously explained that the asset purchase programme of the Eurosystem central banks includes three different purchase programmes: financial covered bonds (covered bonds), asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank buys bonds from the market to encourage investors who sold bonds to invest money elsewhere.
Under the influence of purchases, the rate of return of lower-risk assets will fall and this motivates investors to take greater risks.
As a general rule, each central bank purchases its government bonds in the framework of the public bond purchase programme, no bonds from other countries will be purchased.
Since the Estonian state has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank makes so-called replacement purchases within the volume allocated to them.
The replacement works are also made by central banks in those countries where the provision of bonds corresponding to the purchase programme is limited.
According to Hansson, Eesti Pank generally buys bonds from European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Investment Bank's bonds.
Eesti Pank will buy bonds in the asset purchase programme since March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering's bonds were also purchased, but since June 2016, Eesti Pank will no longer buy Elering's bonds.
As of June, the central bank of both Elering and Eesti Energia buys bonds on behalf of the central banks of the euro area.
Travelers ignore the ditch and return to the "millionaire district"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands have come to a fierce confrontation with determined travelers who have ignored the council's ditch ditched to defeat the field that is away from their villas.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans on the field near Solihull Street, a wealthy "millionaire district."
They have returned with the army of horses, children and trucks after they were only knocked out in May, without letting themselves be disturbed by a ditch dug into their invasion of the council.
The Tactic Group found a weak position in guards, squeezing its vehicles from the part not blocked, which had been left as a footpath.
The rabies inhabitants have cherished the Solihull Council, saying that the council is "effective in dealing with the problem."
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after their exemplary from Bentley Heath, where they threw the passers-by with stones.
The council must be humiliated so that they enter into action, because they are useless to deal with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were driven away, and now they're back.
They came to the night, probably even more today."
He added: "Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by getting long barriers to protect our parks.
I live on Streetsbrook, and I am not happy that I have to continue paying the council tax if the council is unable to even prevent such a thing."
One local resident, who also wanted to remain anonymous, said: "This is ridiculous.We saw the last of these travelers, and there is already a new offensive.
This time, the number has increased and has even seen a horse in the grassland."
The representative of the council of Niilihull said: "We are aware that there is an unacceptable campsite in the country near Streetbrook road, and we are working with the Solihull police.
The collection of evidence is very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the case for the court when we present the case to them."
Among all others, the Weekend Festival will also be visited by the Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, who is glad that true top names of the world have been brought to Estonia.
To the question of why the Weekend festival is so important for Estonians, Saar answers that it should be asked of all those who enjoy the stories of the festival to the fullest.
However, he admits that real players in their field have arrived in Pärnu.
"While looking at the level of artists that has been brought to Estonia, the absolute top names of this music genre will be brought home - this often does not happen in our area," says the Minister of Culture.
What artists will perform at the festival, but do Saart speak the most?
I consider myself a relatively old man, and for old people like me, is definitely one of the most experienced artist Armin van Buuren, who performed last night.
According to his record twist, everything of us has complicated our leg at some point," he says.
However, he also brings out a number of names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian players: starting with NO-P and they can be read a whole line.
In reality, this concentration of known names is very high," he says.
Take a closer look at the Evening Newspaper video!
Audi renews up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the middle of car manufacturers
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW said that it offers software additions to more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to the Chairman of BMW, the company believes that "i.e. there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities, including the home town of BMW Munich, which has considered the ban or restriction of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would renew three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce the exhaust emissions of diesel engines.
None of the companies described these activities as a recall.
European car manufacturers have eagerly advertised the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to help comply with the regulations on carbon dioxide emissions.
However, nitric oxide emitted from compression-ignition engines is considered a carcinogen and may result in asthma.
The cost of the equipment to be installed for motor vehicles to be fuelled to be fuelled for motor vehicles is also increasing for automotive companies, making the price of cars difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under thorough investigation, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of infiltrating the signs and labelling referring to the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen's mistakes, who quieted down the use of so-called fraudulent devices, which made it possible to adjust the exhaust gas reading to the regulation by the time of testing the car, but withdrawn in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen drivers have been charged in the United States and others are under the control of the Atlantic Ocean on both sides.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamic division of the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Mr former President, Mr Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be brought to justice in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was auctioned in Germany about Volkswagen when the authorities accused the Audit of installing the system in order to evade the requirements of European waste water emissions, thereby extending the investigation focused previously on the United States.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation may be a major blow to Volkswagen - a luxury car manufacturer generates a disproportionately large part of Volkswagen's profit.
The flags of the European Union will be acquired for 20,000 euros for Estonian schools.
The Ministry of Education intends to buy the flags of the European Union to replace the Presidency by 1 September.
In total, 570 educational institutions of the European Union's flag will receive 105x158 centimetres with dimensions.
Flags are intended for exhibition indoors, they must be performed in high-quality printing equipment in indoors with tunnel fastening, mediated by the ERR news portal.
The flag shadow label contains the text: "Considering Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Estonian Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of 570 flags is 20,000 euros at the price of the Ministry of Education, i.e. one flag costs 35 euros.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes the growing threat situation in Mexico
The employees of the Riodoce week usually gather on Wednesdays to review the plans to reflect the most recent chase of the Sinaloa state, which are sown organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But today, in the shadow of a personal tragedy, they have gathered to discuss their own security.
They're told that it's important to change your routines.
Two older writers are discussing which seems safer: either to bring the children to the office that was the target for the grenade attack in 2009 or to leave them home.
Security experts have written three words on the board at the head of the room: "enhibiants," "neutral," "Union."
They ask reporters to offer names in every column - there's no need for evidence, impression and inner feeling is enough.
When being on the payroll of the government or cartels, drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of being a whole list of redresss that dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico.
There is no break of breath, and the more bodies across the country, the majority of them are formed according to the Committee on the Promost of the Journalists - since the inauguration of President Enrique Pena Nieto, at least 25.89 journalists have been killed after attacks and threats under state protection, and during this year at least seven journalists have died in seven states.
The latter are their editor and source of inspiration, Javier Valdez Cardenas, co-founder of Riodoce.
"It is a more serious mistake to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many reports on drug violence.
His absence gives profoundly felt, although his presence can be perceived everywhere on the facade of the Riodoce building, a large picture of Valdez, showing the middle finger, with the letter "The Valley" and two reporters in the 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts showing his smiling glasses face or a characteristic panorama hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death, reports discuss a joint trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate public prosecutor's office was established to deal with cases of journalists in 2010, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two cases have been held responsible for judicial liability.
Like most annual assassinations of drugs and organised crime, ranging from thousands, the number of journalists, rarely come to justice.
The Riodoce editorial office continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts have been broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, a security meeting, Ibarra said, without data and justice, no benefit.
"It's very stupid to waste your time at this meeting," he says.
"As long until the cause is known, mistrust everyone."
Valdez left the city of Riodoce, the state, from the office of Riodoce, the state, on the morning of May 15.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before two men stopped his red Toyota Corolla, forced to leave the car and was shot 12 times, allegedly because of the name of the newspaper, which means translated "twoteen rivers."
The armed man drove away in Valdez's car and crashed it near him.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Rumors are spreading freely in Culiacan.
However, there is mainly silence on Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and the United States of extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the bloodiest battle challenges in the country, because the squabbles are fighting for the performance of the power vacuum.
It doesn't matter that a person or several people are shot on the streets of your consent every day, or that the graveyard is dilly decorated from the mausoleums of double drug kings, which are larger than many living homes.
For a moment, let us forget that the time of peace indicates how valuable ports and drug routes to the United States lead only one cartel.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the co-founder and manager of Riodoce feels the huge sceptions that he could not defend his friend.
He believes that two mistakes were facilitated by killing.
The first of them was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopezz, the leader of the cartel in a competitive and war-led cartel with the sons of Guzman's sons in February.
This writing could piss off his sons - suspected power members bought all the copies of the publication as soon as they got into the church kilos.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country on behalf of his own security after the raid in another newspaper editorial board that reflected the same story took place.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always exist.
He worked as a veteran reporter at Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50-dollar units.
Bojorquez said that Sinaloas "the impossible to deal with the press without touching a drug problem."
The newspaper collected awareness of its bold and honest coverage and sales and advertising increased over time.
Reporters liked to publish vigorous studies without fear of censorship and enchanting readers in the print, which they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its Latin American coverage.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Prize for Freedom of Journalists" Freedom of Justice (AKK) for its courage to follow Mexican drug stories wherever it leads.
He admitted frankly that he was afraid.
"I want to keep living," he said, accepting the AKK Award.
Last October, he told the television channel Rompeviento TV that drug trafficking was a way of life in Sinaloa.
"You should embrace the task of the journalistic office - another way to play.
I don't want to ask me what I did to face so many deaths, or why I didn't tell me what was going on."
Riodoce's collective longs Valdez, a joker who scribed like a throbbing, a friend who kindly shared embraces and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They gave up his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from the office to El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if his routine love was fatal for him.
His death has also made them doubt about how to do his work best and survive.
"They don't like to deny these women, their children, their legal businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs."
"They weren't supposed to be touched," Bojorquez said.
The result is strong self-censorship and self-considering even in the best days.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
According to Andres Villarreal, editor of Riodoce, the problem is that "the sniff's brain can be deceived... and that's how this happened to Javieriga."
He and others say that you do not have old rules, just as they do not apply to the toxic combination of smuggling officials in Tamaulipas, Veracruzi, Guerreros or other states that are home to the smuggler, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce's employees met for security training, mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed; some days before that it was revealed that only the spyware sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two police officers searched in the shadow of the tree of flame from 40 degrees of heat.
The government appointed them to guard Riodoce's office in a four-storey building in Culiacan's middle-class neighborhood.
Some reporters contemplated half-winning whether these police officers were among the 50 per cent of the police officers whose governor himself has unreliably stamped.
Several months have passed since the reporters have travelled to mountainous countries, where control is de facto drugpower in the hands.
Riodoce's edition this week dealt with three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had an open story about spending government money on the governor's home town.
And a group of people were kidnapped from Culiacan's office from one of the most expensive restaurants in the prosecutor's office.
There was no official announcement of who was abducted or how it happened, so it had to be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city - the restaurant is both drug dealers and authorities' favourite place.
Reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician who is in power in the Institutive Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century.
Lately, several of the governors of the IRP have been accused of widespread coverage of corruption within the framework of cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, including how the son of Guzman, wearing nickname El Chapo, got into the military.
Not only a few months earlier, readers would have been looking for a column in Valdez to obtain information about kidnapping from the best sources.
"We would have known what happened," said the 46-year-old Villarreal, whose ecleneu body building has earned him nickname El Flaco.
"Now all communication channels have been cut off with our sources."
Valdez's office has received a storage room for labels and stickers that protest against the murder of journalists, and the editorial staff has received anything that they never expected activists for the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went to the local prosecutor's office next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the killing of Valdez.
The body has been found, and according to officials, it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests.
Journalists have become more vocal all over the country and, as a protest scribbleed, organised protest on the sidewalks and buildings, the phrase "SOS press."
On that day, the President, Mr Bojorquez, is absent in Washington, trying to collect international support for justice in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's death, Ramirez accused the authorities of office for spying on journalists and talking about the truth about their murder.
After that, he asked him to redirect his activities to the part of the government, worrying that the anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were 'limited' by organised crime, fellow-educational state officials and indifferent society.
In his last book "Narko Journalism," he wrote that reporters not only kill drug gangs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces who are in the mests with organised crime.
Last year, the Media Randal Monitoring Group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of the attack on the police and state officials.
"You die in the Mexican because they want to silence you," Ramirez said.
The murders are obviously blinking.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state in Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a letter, which was probably signed by the Carella Los Zetas: "I'm here for my report."
Next to his wrecked head, the computer keyboard and the headphones were lying.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as a newspaper in Chihuahua, the northern border part of El Norte, after the killing of their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue as he did, as the El Manana de Nuevo Laredo newspaper was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, the Fair de Ciudad Juarez spoke to the drug cartel with the editorial "What do you want from us?" on the metrorchandise.
Some journalists have fled homeland or even from the country.
It's a whistle-weet decision.
It's hard to find a job in exile, and they still have to stick the streets to avoid dangers.
And sometimes they are being chased, as probably the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after the ban on Veracruz.
Those who stay in place and continue to work must dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that reflecting the drug trade scares him.
"Mechaiko is on his way to hell, and that's why I started reporting," he said.
On a recent Friday midnight, when the latest number had already been locked, Riodoce's editors sat on the pavement on the pavement in front of the office and racing beer, when suddenly all the phones began to be vibrating.
According to firefighting, Mazatlan, Mazatlan, a confirmed person was recorded in firefights between rival gangs and security forces.
War escalated, as several left messages from the cartels found in the region promised.
From the same edge of the pavement, reporters put the news on the mud website using the Riodoce website.
The front cover of the next day needed to be amended.
The sirens snatched along another firefight area.
Bojorquez peek to guarding police to see if they are vigilant.
Even if they were afraid, they didn't show it at least.
Under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, on which his average finger can be seen for the entire Sinaloa, Riodoce's employees were edited in his footsteps.
"How could I think about closing at all," said Bojorquez, "If Javier was killed, asked for an internship to send him to the streets to make a report?"
Dinosaurus used a protective color to prevent the enemy
At first glance, it seems like a shape, albeit rather scary.
Scientists have now published the first findings in connection with the manifestation of the incredible rhino found in the miner discovered, which has been so well preserved that the experts have described it as "the Mona Lisat."
It has been so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that the skin covered with his armored was reddish brown paint and his past had been somewhat "croperle."
The report published in Current Biology described the creature as "the best preserved gender somours, which has ever been found" and "one of the best dinosaurs around the world."
Fossil is a new species of noodles, which in the middle of the elastritis era, 110-112 million years ago.
Its unbelievably good preservation of bog knowledgeers who describe it as "truely remarkable."
This armored vegetarian is the best preserved fossil of the type of fossil that has ever been found in the best data of the magazine National Geographic.
It was found on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined Suncor Millenium mine at Fort McMurray near Northern Albertas in Canada.
He hit something that didn't resemble the surrounding stone, and decided to look more closely.
An observable fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrel Paleontology Museum.
The next six years were working to dig out the animal from the 2500-sound (1100 kilos) parcel.
After all this hard work, the end result is now finally ready to bring the end to the public.
"If you squint a little bit, you can almost believe that he sleeps," said Caleb Brown, researcher at the Royal Tyrrels Museum, where the creature is exhibited.
"It goes to the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
When studying his skin, scientists found that this plant eater, who is covered with armored and recalls a walking tank, was likely to have a significant threat to meat-fashioned dinosaurs.
This dinosaur with lots of armored armored used red and white protective paint to hide from predators, and applied shade technique called against and also used by many modern animals.
According to experts, this allowed the dinosaur to blend better around and avoid enemies, as the major dinosaurs probably hunted him.
This 110 million-year-old creature of the family of nodosaurs reached the news for the first time in May and is now being visited at the Royal Tyrrel Paleontology Museum.
Researchers have now studied his existence and gave a name to it according to Mark Mitchell, the laboratory of the Borealopelta markmitchelli Museum, who belonged to the team that spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover the animal's demanding.
Thanks to the amazing preservation of the specimen, Dr Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the armoreds on the body.
They discovered a method of protection that was common in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the assumption was darker than lower.
Although the recklessness has spread, the findings come as a surprise, as Borealopelta is much greater than living with irresistance today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was actively hunted enough by other carnivores, that the evolution preferred to be obscured instead of confrontation as a survival tactic.
But most of the modern animals that use anti-shash - e.g. deer, sebrad or scarfs - are much smaller and vulnerable as harvests, suggesting that the nodosaurus had to work really hard to survive.
"The violent hunting of a dinosaur covered with large and numerous armoreds shows how dangerous could have been predatory from the dinosaurs," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the armored also revealed that the skin of dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study an animal to get hints of this life, including the preserved contents of this intestine to find out what the animal would not be eaten last.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river, thereby reaching the power of the sea, where he sank the bottom of the ocean in front of him.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as is currently South Floridas, and rivers and oceans were likely to have gone far beyond the inland than it is now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable, as it is fully covered with a slush skin, while he has also remained three-dimensional while maintaining the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"As a result, today, the animal looks almost the same as in the Cretaceous age.
To reconstruct it, you do not have to use a lot of imagination - it just wants to squeak his eyes and it seems that he would sleep."
The horsereas was a time when huge two legs were driven by muscle heating dinosaurs - tero stores.
Although the rex of all of their king, Tyrannosaurus, millions of years later, they could hunt for some of his terrifying predecessors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, 38 ft (11.5 meters) long and six tons of monster weighing.
Researchers whose recent findings are published in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta washed after death in the sea and mumifitus muddy muddy.
On March 21, 2011 was discovered by Shawn Funk when he mineed Millenium mine near Fort McMurray near NorthernAlbertas Canada.
According to the museum, this is best preserved in the world of bolus, including the skin and swamps, and it is a complete cone to hips.
These beings were on average 18 ft (five meters) long and weighed up to GBP 3000 (1300 kg).
Two 20 inches of the valley were evaded from its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this plant eater covered with armored adventures through the current West Cannada until the flooded river over its outer sea washed.
But the seament of the dinosaur was helped to maintain its scale in an excellent detail.
The stoned remains of this particular specimen has been so well preserved that the headbone of the dinosaur, the headbone of the dinosaur, is still covering skin remains.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic: "Such a range of preservation is as rare as a lotto victory.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
Stone-coated skin rechargers still cover myary-bruption plates on the skull of the animal.
A better fore legs lie next to him, and five toes are stretched upwards.
I can count the scales on his winter."
How did one activist find an answer to the question "Kelle Streets?"
On August 9, 2014 Brittany Ferrell got a complete shock.
Just the day after travelling to New York, this St. Louis resident sit in a bed room on the bed, browsing on the phone on Facebook.
He ended up with his former schoolmate post.
It said, "The police killed an 18-year-old adolescent and is still lying on the street."
He was confused about why no one else had posted this information in his stream, so he closed Facebook and opened up on Twitter.
The Pidemega -TheePharoah's user posts were repeatedly shared on his time line.
The rapper from St. Louis's region broadcasted real-time tweets about the death of an unarmed 18-year-old black young man who was killed by a white cop in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's remorse body on the street, remaining there for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell thought of himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He put his phone away, but later saw a tweet again in the evening, which announced this time about the gathering of people on Canfield Drive.
Photos of police bird and screaming people and a man who claimed to be Brown's father and kept the sign "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
He watched a real-time stream where the police stood in front of the protesters' group with a barking dog.
In the second video, another cop said he was whistled by a gun and screamed, "I kill all of you... animals."
Ferrello remembers how he hit himself from the idea, "It's unusual."
"It's not a murder of the kind of thing we're used to and what we could call typical."
I felt fearful at that moment.
I was angry and cried.
He booked the return flight and went home the next day.
After landed at 23 o'clock, his father went after his six-year-old daughter and decided they were driving two of Ferguson the next morning.
What took place with Ferrelli and Ferguson in the next three years is the central theme in the new documentary "Whose Streets?" ("Kelle Streets?"), which will be premiered in the cinemas on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and strength, and strength from the point of view of the people who live in this community and who fulfilled the streets in order to meet the answers.
When Ferrell and his daughter - who had a flowery dress on his back and a suitable crown in his head - Ferguson drove back, they talked about a topic that had been discussed several times before this morning - about the experience and living conditions of black people.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for his rights?" he recalls asking himself.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't take him with him," Ferrell said later.
"What is happening now is... the culmination of what happened in the past.
He needs to know and see it and grow in the middle.
He must learn about activism and organization and, at the same time, know the different layers of black experience and living conditions, and what we need to do to get free and free ourselves.
Even if I manage to raise him so that he does not personally experience a Jew racism, he is not different from another black girl.
I feel like I would do a disservice to him if I were to protect him from this world."
The first stop they made when Ferguson was on his way to South Florisant - in a place across the police station, which had received a certain kind of campsite, where the activists were waiting for news about the police officer Darren Wilson, who was finally not charged.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who made lunches.
They put food bags together and helped to share them with protestors.
For Ferrelli, the shape of new types of activistism began to slowly take.
"My Activism changed completely after 9 August," he said, noting that when he was a student at the University of Missouri-St Louis, he was the President of the Lessed Study Association and focused on food law and health-related inequalities in black communities.
"I had no organizational experience.
It all just worked out."
Weeks later, during the evening demonstration, Sabaah Folayan, a co-director of a film, met.
Folayan said that he and film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what was happening.
The question arose in Ferrelli's head: "Do you try to document what is happening or find a story that can be exploited?"
This blue scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white skins - come into the community and try to benefit from its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson is not listened to and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already beaten his hands with co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the region known for activism in connection with death sentenced prisoners.
His involvement made the project a binder for Ferrelli and the six other locals, the team watching after Brown's shooting for years.
"No one talks about us or us in this documentary, but we speak for ourselves," Davis said.
"It was important for me how these people were depicted, because that is what I am depicted."
Although the goal was not to focus on Ferrelli's experience - it was intended to show that the movement does not "manage leader, but in the composition of the community," as Folayan - became the most open part of the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" is documenting surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrel's life, such as falling in love and marrying her with his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing at the first time he saw the film.
"But I realized that the human identity of this work and humanize black people must be accompanied by certain vulnerability."
Moreover, Ferrelli's story emphasizes and reigns the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators of the movement, who, on social media, thought of the topic of the execution of Black Trayvon Martin in 2012 is homosexual.
"Many homosexual women in the management role have kept moving overall," said Ferrell, 'and because we have to fight on several fronts all the time.
Black homosexual women must bear this whole burden."
Folayan agreed, noting that 'the movement is indeed kept alive by black women and many of them are non-skinned homosexual women'.
At the same time, he argues that "there is not some kind of thing of creating equal opportunities" - Ferrelli was not chosen as the centre of the film because of his identity.
"He was a person who blew up the right energy," he said.
"But it is not a coincidence that he was located directly on the front line because living at such knots as a black homosexual woman living at such knots.
His energy can be perceived through the screen."
At the same time, news cameras from Ferguson have long disappeared, but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
The ad hoc sentence imposed on Ferrelli for blocking the highway during the demonstration lasts for another 2.5 years.
He describes the socio-political atmosphere in the region he calls home simply "surpassing threat."
Nevertheless, he still considers the mantra he has equated since he has passed the memory since he went to the streets three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our responsibility to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
7 tips on how to overcome the Weekend party from the hangover
Some of the strongest male cubs find after a scarce party that help from which to help.
Or you're based on the saying "allow hangover, stay drunk."
But it's just an inevitable postponement and a decent drought for health.
What can you do to feel better in the morning after today and tomorrow's Weekend's troll - feel better in the morning and get over the hangover as painlessly as possible?
Drink some water.
Down on alcohol and after a big party in the morning... or even instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses a lot of fluid when drinking alcohol, it must somehow be returned.
The minerals are washed out of the body together with water and it is therefore good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often upset after the sintering, it is especially good if it is bubble-free or only slightly gazed.
Go for a walk.
I'm sure you shouldn't go to Grandma to break the trees with a hangover - it could be a fatal false decision.
But a slight walk helps the body to recall again what it's like to be alive.
Going out in the camp and sleeping with a hangover is a time-consuming way to heal.
Give the body the energy back slowly and cautiously.
If you're already out of drinking from yesterday to be in the bequest, you should definitely not try to charge a big fat steak.
Start, for example, from fresh juice, which includes fruit sugars to slowly relievably your body.
If the health already suffers in the middle of lunch, you could try, for example, a broth.
And a little later, backbone.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic may release your body from the last water.
As has already been said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you take an analgesic to prevent hangover in the evening, then your liver must also deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in the evening and lose performance.
This is how you ruin your liver even more, and in the future, the hangovers will be worse.
In addition, there is not enough painkiller in the body anyway.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don't do it in an empty stomach - it irritates your already-torn stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, you can get along well with yourself.
It's about the same way as walking, but walking can't orgasm.
However, it was avoided too active and crazy poses - during the hangover, the physical effort should be moderate.
Make it a good time.
Talking with friends and catascomants, make simple stupid and laugh friendlyly at yourself and others (s).
False and laughter may not be driven by a hangover, but it is definitely more fun with them to tolerate the after-faces with them.
Once the hangover goes over anyway!
Northwestern Professor and Oxford University employee are being sought as a suspect in murder
According to the police, a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford, who have become suspects after finding the body of a man with deadly stabbing wounds from a Chicago luxury apartment, is being searched national.
According to Cook County's court documents, no arrest warrant orders were issued without bail on Monday to arrest the 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren on charges of the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, due to their alleged involvement.
According to documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated stabbing.
According to the warning that the Chicago Police Department issued to the community, the body was discovered on 27 July.
The police received a phone call and found a victim for the Grand Plaza apartment building, whose body had several cakes wound.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene and investigators deal with stabbing as a murder, while the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has been working as a co-professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of Public Relations at the University, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem has now been temporarily removed from work and is forbidden to enter the campuses of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal case of the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates with researchers," Cubbage said.
Warren is an older assistant in the Financial Department of Oxford University.
A representative of the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and ready to help U.S. investigative authorities in every possible way."
In addition, the statement stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give himself up.
Anthony Guglielmi, Head of Communications Department at the Chicago Police Department, urges the suspects to give themselves up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea where they are, but we are working more and more intensively defining the exact location," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, the suspects are helped to search for local, regional and national authorities.
Guglielmi said that the police received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment building, who had just received a cryptic hint that something had happened in the apartment No. 1008.
According to the police's descriptions, this was a hideous viewing picture.
According to Guglielm, it is not clear whether the event itself also took place on 27 July.
He said the security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren's stay in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielm added.
The management of Grand Plaza sent a letter to the residents: "The police are currently working on the identification of the background of the events and the victim and explores different motives, including the possibility that it was a family dispute."
Start-ups to help your company prevent your company from becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees at his e-commerce start-up, but the surveys were profitable.
Responses were often vague, useless or, worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs a 75 e-commerce company Madison Reed, an e-commerce company selling hair care products operating in San Francisco.
So he called for the help of external persons.
There are new start-ups dealing with a type of human resources in the shirt that help companies find out what their employees feel.
Developing and licensing software, the purpose of which is to measure the involvement of employees, allow companies to make sudden and surveys, aim for specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaints on a hot line and, in some cases, to allow language carriers to follow C-level leaders and turn directly to the management board.
"Now there are tools such as Strava and Fitbit, which are intended to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City start-ups Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees' involvement.
According to Errett, in three years he has used Glint, he has gained a much better overview of what his employees think and feel.
In addition to sudden research and surveys aimed at specific teams, it offers a heat card from the company, which gives an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing him to find out the reasons.
Companies have begun to realise that they must stay aware of their work culture, so as not to become the next Uber, which has been wrapped in scandals since the former employee published a blog post describing the harassing environment that punished those who dared to speak.
For start-ups like Glint, the desire to have an overview of the income is a business opportunity.
The global area of governance, regulation and compliance may be worth more than 18.7 billion dollars by 2020 according to the FinTech statistics on the Let's Talks Payments website.
The Fallen City Center, a start-up in Denver, Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, observed interest and activity growth in the backdrop of Uber's suspicious reputation.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered itself as a customer.
As Glintki, Convercent allows companies to send customized pulse heating, collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat maps from problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous messaging line that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
And if the CEO is concerned, complaints go directly to the board.
"The current opinion has been given by the regulatory authorities," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
Quinlan said that if it is found that the company treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, the company could face serious consequences, such as consumers' boycotts, workers' leave and lawsuits, even if regulators do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees at 500 sites, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure staff awareness of the rules and actions and to provide an easy way to communicate with the headquarters of the corporation.
If the employee wanted to report the problem earlier, he had to find the phone number or e-mail address of the corporation headquarters, submit an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a deterrent and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday general advisor James Vitrano, who said that there was no good way to monitor the complaints of employees.
However, now that the company uses Convercent, there are possible problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage trainees, which did not reach earlier managers who operated in other cities or states, to identify and deal with them more quickly.
"I can get closer to the Holistic 360-degree experience of employees," said Vitrano, who runs Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"And we protect our shareholders for litigation with employees."
Quinlan said that companies began to take ethical behaviour, values and involvement of employees much more seriously in 2002, i.e. after Arthur Andersen, an auditing company, collapsed due to ethical violations in connection with Enron's scandal.
But only when the social media became mature," the companies realised that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from being washed online in public.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, taking a periodic fee from companies for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been supported by both start-ups.
Convercenti financed 10 million dollars in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, thereby raising the value of the capital collected to the value of USD 47 million.
Glint invested 10 million dollars in November by Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing the company's total funding to 60 million dollars.
Such investments do not come as a surprise, taking into account the interconnectivity of companies, culture and risk capital.
More and more studies show that modern workers expect more from the workplace than before.
In competitive markets such as the Silicon Valley, there are high wages and interesting projects merely on the table contributions.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued, and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy in the company, feel that they are listened to and that the work they do is satisfying, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of the General Help Department, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn income if the companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If the third-party analytics tools allow to increase the commitment and involvement of employees, then it is no wonder that they will find support.
Having data about the involvement of employees is important, according to experts from working culture.
However, these data is useless if the after-trusts of the company do not go with them.
In fact, if the company asks for feedback from its employees, it may create expectations that there are any changes ahead.
And if the changes do not occur quickly enough or at all, this could cause disappointment and reduce the involvement of workers.
"If you ask for 4,000 proposals, you must be ready for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of the consulting and business management company Kotter International, who has seen how companies make a mistake by relying on too much data collection.
"Because if things don't be brought to the end, the staff think, "Do you actually listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?"
According to Errettt, Madison Reed, who now conducts research among employees once a month, has been able to take measures on the same day as the problem has been reported via Glint.
And after making decisions at speed and receiving feedback from the employees disappointed with the quality of communication, he was able to reorganise several teams in the company and offer communication training to deal with problems.
However, Ruby Tuesdays collects new data on employees and it is hoped that in the long term, it will lead to a long-term commitment of employees in an industry known for the flow of its large workforce.
"If you're not committed to ensuring transparency, you lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you'll lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies."
The bright star of the euro area is Baltikum: income grows fast
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic states are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg, referring to the report of the European Central Bank.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999, gross economic production per capita has exceeded expectations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
Good luck is a low debt burden, rapid-enhancing institutions and business and free market-friendly policies.
"The Baltic countries, one with Slovakia, are among the few countries in the euro area where the real-KDP per capita has significantly approached the EU average," the central bank stated.
Although the aim is that the total production of the economy per capita per capita with a richer Western Europe, in 2015, the total annual production of the Baltic economies per capita was represented by only 2/3 of the average of 15 countries that belonged to the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led the Baltics to seek better wages from abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is growing this year, local residents are not enthusiastic at all.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the Latvian and Lithuanian people assessed that their economies are doing very well or rather good.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, it was expected to be slightly less than half of those surveyed about their economies.
NCAA's decision to cancel the trainings that take place twice a day makes Bruins' Days long
It's almost 23 o'clock when the UCLA footballers stop talking on the team's campus on the edge of the new training ground.
Some of them have peeled off a shirt, revealing a sweaty back from the efforts of their training camp for the first day.
For a large part of the team, these moments of strength offer a break from noon.
Players will take part in summer courses to study into the final examination after three hours of training before returning to the Wasserman Football Centre for meetings at 6:30 p.m.
"The next three days is a real challenge for them," said Bruins' coach Jim Mora a little before it got Tuesday from Monday.
The NCAA's decision to cancel the trainings for reducing the burden of players twice a day, have actually changed their days longer - at least until the final examinations are reached on Friday.
For this reason, the first three trainings were timed to start at 19.15 in order to fit in the already tight schedule of players.
The transition from two trainings per day means more days with one workout - the beginning of the Bruins training camp was raised almost a week forward compared to last season, and for the first time during the six Westwood seasons, trainings take place during the summer courses.
From now on 20 August, they will have 18 workouts before official preparation for the opening match in September against Texas A&M will begin.
According to Mora, he is in favour of the change of the NCAA rule, although it adds another item to the seasons of players.
"They have a huge burden on three or four days and this is a serious challenge," Mora said.
"And they break through this challenge; they make an effort, they are great young.
I think when it comes Saturday and we have more time, it's really nice."
When the camp is over, UCLA's training makes sure that is not an easy task, given the clear view of the parking lot close to their squares and from the adjacent Lusk Centre, a higher class hotel that has already hit footballs around the gateposting network.
From this weekend, Bruins' players will occupy the hotel, but Mora admitted that problems may occur during the season with free rooms.
"We welcome security measures," Mora said.
"This is a real concern and it is not exaggerated at all to think that people can rent a room and from there to film training.
If you have a recording of training, you can make a pretty good deal.
But we're using a security team in the 8th parking lot.
We will do the best by using ourselves.
I'm trying not to worry about it.
We have a plan in place.
The Savisaar-Ivanova Electoral Association, Kristiina Ojuland, and Maria Kaljuste, and the voting association of businessmen, created by joining the forces of Maria Kaljuste, created by joining the forces of EKRE, born to the Centre Party, will show the Association of Businessmen in Tallinn - it seems that the electoral coalition created in the party policy will take at least as much as the parties to the local elections this year.
However, chicks are counted in the autumn, and the key question will be whether there are enough disappointed voters for them to all.
Who's with Savisaar?
If the supporter of Edgar Savisaar has decreased small, the supporter of Edgar Savisaar may not be guessed of the events organised in honour of his election coalition.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and current Centre Party members and many unknown faces - is this the composition of the Electoral Union?
And can there be a reason why some faithful followers and friends of Savisaar are holding out the stand aside and friends of Savisaar, led by corruptions, led by corruptions, are it a reality?
The music video filmed on the roof of the city government to a Russian-language pop song, in which the older of the Lasnamäe district participates; and, in all respect, the initial computer game, in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, the protagonist, must the puddles and squirrels on the road - whether this is how the Centre Party catches the voices of 16 and 17-year-old voters allowed to be elected to the ballot boxes for the first time?
We will wait to see what the idea of other parties is about the youthful election campaign.
If a black square is viewed to the viewer of Channel 2 or TV3 since the beginning of August instead of the entertainment show, there will be two options: to accept that in the future, only ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and English-language France24 channels can be submitted or every month for a ten-month-long television operator.
There are probably also those who, at first, please publicly rejoice at the advertising-free television experience, but in the end - albeit reluctantly - pay for television and advertisements.
The curb music, noisy people and junk left on the streets are unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you don't want to know the memory of ourselves, but instead of the pain of his head, it's worthwhile to go to discover the home - and leave the place of sleeping for a hefty amount for the festival guests.
Washington changes the rules of the Green Card
Media publications quote President Donald Trump, who said that a new U.S. immigration plan is scheduled for change the rules of the green card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants per year for 50,000 people per year, stricter rules in obtaining temporary working visas and restrictions in relation to family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and the President supports them.
The bill goes to the discussion in two Chambers of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money, as it changes the way in which green cards are issued to citizens of other countries in the United States.
The law reduces chain migration and begins to replace the current programme.
The new application process gives an advantage to candidates who speak English and have the funds to support themselves and the skills that benefit our economy," Trump said, according to the media outlets in the United States.
The young people of Siberia are moving back to the country, retired.
Jevseyev Anatolylia continues the tradition of the famous Seto gold miners around the former Maana River.
He works 140 kilometres from home at Maana's tribune on the side of the tribune crochet in theater on the side of the Estonian tribune.
It is a harsh job: two months in a row without 12 hours of rest, and then only ten days at home and back again.
Over the three years worked in Artelli, Anatoly has seen gold only once.
"There is a hard time: when going in, it will be thoroughly checked that vodka does not bring with you, and when going out, not to bring gold," says Anatoly.
Mare Piho talking to the local Seto Jaan in Haida village, who has told him a lot about the memories of his family in Siberia.
The archaic culture of the Siberian sediments is also beginning to affect home-seek, because it is just so fabulous, thinks that Piho Mare, who studied distant sediments the most thoroughly.
His first research trip to Siberia will pass 30 years this year.
During this time, he's been there 14 times and lived there for a total of one year.
How many settles travelled to Siberian at the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century to get land here?
This is an unresolved question.
I'm saying 8,000.
I calculated this according to Siberian Seto's men, who have thought about it myself.
It is difficult to say exactly, because up to 30 people could come in one group at the time, but the passport was given only to a man.
The passport was given only one, but he had children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look how big this territory was here!
It was many times bigger than historical Setomaa.
It was necessary to educate it, manage in some way.
The cons came here as peasants, but their life changed, because here they came to the areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (pageing), gold mines, industry.
For example, in Uus-Petser, many of the sets later went to work in Krasnoyarrsk-45 (I was building a Soviet gymnastics enrichment plant - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did sediments accounted for the majority of the population in this region at the time?
Yeah, they lived in a lot.
In addition, the tradition of getting married and multilimetency remained a long time.
Seven-eight children in the family were common.
How much was the culture of Siberian Semosphere different and differ from that of the northern denomination of the motherland?
They are different, even though what was brought here was once the same.
They brought very many folk costumes.
They did themselves themselves (peoples), but they always made a difference that had been brought along and what had been done here.
Climate change strongly influenced the traditional clothing of sediments, because it's colder.
The food changed.
For example, Setooma of the meat was salted, but here they just frozen.
Where are the villages of Siberian Seto and what life there live? / graphics: Alari Paluots
Communication with motherland was mentally strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now this Seumaa is going to give back there, begins to influence them.
Those girls who have lived in this family have listened to amazing stories.
Piho means the people of the Estonian Seto delegation, who came to the village of Haida to the Seto kingdom day and lived in homes for four days - J. P.
What's left here is amazing.
"It is extremely easy to come and go away, because the city has a great starting point: at the railway junction and the crossing point of the highways," says Reigo Tamm, opera soloist from Tapa.
For a long time, the city is not just a military capital, we have a lot of nature, sports and cultural places, and the pizza can be obtained on every corner.
Tapa is a top-notch town!
There is a small island on the White River running from the city, where the slayers usually keep a Midsummer Party.
"It doesn't seem to be a beautiful place from the train window," Reigo smiles.
If you're not afraid of cold water, you can swim in this river, because the river is full of sources.
I've been swimming there, I'm gonna make it!
On the river's on the edge, you can have a picnic and just make romance - you can look at the flow of the river and think in front and behind life.
I've been walking there with my girlfriends, too.
Oceanisolist Tamm has been on the river bank training in the three bridges, saying, "Because this place is by the city, no one may meet if the snoe is the story of their stories."
"The wonderful view of Tapa is also available from Mäännikumäe, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski on the winter and now, for example, play disc golf course - the golf course has been made, the discs can be rented from the sports centre," Reigo leads.
Of course, the old professionals go there with their discs, but I haven't been there yet.
Probably there is a need to invite my colleague Rasmus Kull Tapa to visit, because he is an experienced disc golf player and has discs.
I guess he's borrowing me!
Reigo and Männikumägi were inseparable during the childhood of the current opera sympathy.
At least during ski lessons.
There are many tears, disappointments and you can in my sports life.
Not to mention broken lesions and skis.
"The whole city centre is currently full of construction work, everything changes beyond recognition," Reigo praises.
Tapa, however, the old and tired voucher building is a very attractive place where summer discoveries are played.
I am glad that Märt Meos, the head of R.A.A.Mi, in 2012, accepted my idea and had to make a summer theatre in the station with his theatre.
Although this year's theatre season with "Aleksei Karenin" was just over, on 11 August there is "Elluärk" at the railway station, when the old station building moves around the 1980s.
"Friends from 11 to 13 August, Tapa is the days of the city, in the framework of which the open home cafes have been opened in the station building and there are ransing cultural events, including the folk race," says Reigo, who recommends visiting the city from 91 years in days.
In a small yellow cottage on the breadth of May 1, the museum has been on the castle since 1994.
"The house is small, but there are a lot of exhibits and information enormously," Reigo praises the place full of the history of Tapa, most of which focuses on the railway and warfare.
Reigo smiles that if Tapal all the recommended places go through, the stomach will be empty on a long run, but fortunately the small town is full of cafes.
"We have such good dining places and sometimes feel that you are abroad when sitting in cafes," he describes.
Educated and young soldiers from Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, so there is a strange feeling when sitting there that you are in Estonia and in your hometown, but there is such an international group together around.
I think it would be very exciting to listen to stories from the French or Americans.
The soldiers, yes, are moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal tents in Greece
TV channel bTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who announced that two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal terrification in Greece.
On the morning of 1 August, the police arrested a group of people who have been illegally camped in the Sithonia peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but there's an investigation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the TV channel bTV that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have increased free tents and are already imposing harsh fines on anyone who is caught in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Puppies teach pups go to break sheep.
After a year of a break, Hiiumaa farmers have to give "clearning" to wolves from their herd again - wolves who have probably taught puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, wolves have broken sheep three times in Hiiu County, a total of 23 sheep and injured eight, writes Hiiu Leht.
Last year, the corresponding number was only three, a year earlier 124.
Synchronized with the crushings, the data of the Environmental Agency is also that the wolf litters were not born last year in Hiiumaa and the information of the Hiiumaa Hunting Council is that two wolf litters have been fixed on this island this year.
The night against Monday, the wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna in Emmaste Parish and injured half of 18 survivor sheep.
Early Wednesday morning, the wolves broke one sheep in the pasture of Reheselja village and severely injured another, who had to take a threat.
Rules for the handling of genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law to amend the Genet System of Plants and Plant Protection Act on the release round of the genetically modified organisms into the coordination circle.
The amendment to the Act abandons the creation of a separate database for the locations of genetically modified (GM) crops as well as for operators, to do so in the future, the plant health register will be used.
In addition, the obligation of an GM crop handler to have a prior agreement within a designated radius of the person involved in beekeeping is amended.
Although GM crops are currently not cultivated in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for coexistence of genetically modified and undiscoloured crops.
This is at least as long as there are no decisions to declare Estonian GMO-free," said Sigmar Suu, Head of the Plant Health Department of the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burdens incurred both in the private and public sectors," added the Director.
The Bill repeals the provisions relating to the location and handling of the database of agricultural crops and operators in the GMOVS, establishes requirements for the handling of GM crops and starting an economic activity.
In the context of apiculture, the GM crop grower is hereby directed to inform the cultivation of beekeepers with the obligation to achieve an appropriate agreement with apiculture before starting the cultivation.
The Bill has been sent to ministries to coordinate the Bill.
All parties have the opportunity to get acquainted with it in the information system of the Bills and, if he or she wishes, to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The planned changes affect persons, bees and the Agricultural Board, which operate in the plant-growing sector.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop - maize MON 810 is allowed to grow.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has attracted GM crop.
The reason is that there is no corn pest in Estonia, a European counterpart, in relation to which the maize line MON 810 is resistant.
Also, the varieties of this maize line have been developed for the southern regions, and this is not appropriate in our climate conditions in May.
In 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has ordered studies in the seeds of various zucchini, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia in 2015 and 2016.
The results of the analyses of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain alien genes and, as a result of the study, it was concluded that seeds of rape, maize and soy varieties grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
From the above, in turn, it can be concluded that GM crops are not consciously grown in Estonia and it was also confirmed that there has been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruited "the genius" in Nemanja Maticu's form.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has recruited "creation" in the form of Nemanja Matic, after his debut against the central field player Sampdoria made his debut on Wednesday night.
A player bought over 40 million from Chelsea started in Dublin's last preseason game before Uefa Super Cup Real Madrid on Tuesday, expressing an impression of a defence role while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on offensive trips.
But being excluded from the preseason Asian tour of Blues, Maticul remained struggling with a match and lasted only 45 minutes, Mourinho has to improve the beginning of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, brilliant way of thinking - he has a sense of football," Mourinho said.
"Let's make him achieve the form as soon as possible."
Like Matic, other new recruited Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started at the Aviv stadium, and Mourinho began to set his own starting men by quietly.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho still wanted to recruit three footballers, but he confirmed that the club had already done a "excellent work," concluding contracts with three of his four priority options.
"I am grateful to the club that they were able to realize three of the four," he added.
"I'm even happier if they can make four out of four, but they've worked hard for me."
Another armored snail became a GSM transmitter on August 1st, and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, the first Kurepoeg's transmitter to Sõves became the first Kurepoeg with the transmitter, and this nesting area already flew around, has left the nest site and joined the large collection of the night in Mullutu-Suurlahe.
This is because Sõrves does not have a crop field, writes Saarte Voice.
This Tuesday, for ringing the cranes, another deaf got on the sad son on Muhu Island.
According to Martinson, the installation of escorts is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a deaf son named Mati GSM was supplied with Sõrves Türju.
"His works are all on the Internet: how he went wintering in Spain, coming back to the German-Son border for a long time and came to Saaremaa," Martinson said.
The British inventor had a microchip installed in his body to get into a house and a car with a handip.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to which a microchip was installed so that he could only open his front with a hand gesture, get to the office and even start a car.
The 33-year-old Steven Northam had a small chip between his thumb and name-marker, and now offers this service to companies and private individuals who want to make their lives easier with their life technology.
He has joined forces with the Royal Hospital Consulant-anessio Watson of the Royal Hospital in Winchester, Hantsis, in order to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of the microchip to be installed for cats and dogs, and it takes only 30 seconds into the procedure.
The Northam company also replaces the locks of houses and cars to be compatible with a chip, asking for 300 pounds for one lock.
This married father has installed the technology now at home and in his car, BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The white House exhibit costing thousands of taxpayers.
According to military documents published on the TIME magazine, the White House decided to fly a naval helicopter to pay even 24 000 dollars to the southern show for an event celebrating American production last month.
The Green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, called Marine One, was the central attraction of the event introducing the American construction programmes in the White House on 17 July.
President Donald Trump, senior officials from Vice President Mike Pence and the White House, reported industrial products from all over 50 states during their tour.
The helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited together with a fire truck from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
According to the documents of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the Escaer, the White House Warhouse, who was responsible for operating the helicopter, requested a part of the order of the helicopter, i.e. FARGO, just 36 hours before the landing of the helicopter in the south.
"I wanted you to be aware of this, because it was an unusually high-quota event," said HMX-1 Commander the day before the event to your boss, the deputy of the naval officer in the field of aviation.
The message indicated that the helicopter would arrive in the southyard on the morning of July 17th be the event starting at 5 p.m. and stay there until the yard is cleaned between 18 and 21 o'clock in the same evening.
The fact that if leaving the White House were to be left, there was a need for a second ekipacha for the return flight due to the restrictions on working time.
The initial flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, and the escalator's security team remained close to the aircraft throughout its time of stay on the ground.
It was not possible to read in the documents given to the TIME magazine whether or not the second crew needed in the end.
The Hatchi law prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
Documents show that HMX-1 examined whether this event could violate this provision.
"We asked if it would break Hatch law, and we were told not to ruin," wrote the commander.
"It seems you don't have a choice," said the deputy of leading officer.
The White House declared the event "America made" an official event, and the Hatch law would not have covered it.
But even at official events, there are political undertones.
At the event, the President supported the health reform efforts at the time in the event and praised the efforts to keep the government's regulations in the control.
Using the named Marine One or Air Force One under the name is not a new phenomenon for politically profitable purposes.
The presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them for a purely photo session is unusual.
Trump was under attention in February when, at his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, the presidential plane rolled, and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about how his predecessor was used by the president plane.
"The Valgel House is very pleased to display "America made in America," where products from all 50 states were represented, manufactured by American workers from American materials," said Lindsay Walters, acting spokesperson for the White House.
HMX-1 teams often rehearse around Washington and in the south yard to practice setting down the White House of the President of the United States with a centimeter accuracy.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, the HMX-1 White House held 58 rehearsals.
According to the official, the flight to the "American" flight crew was included in the number of the number of the monthly training flights.
Escater helicopters also flew 11 hours "non-president-related support issues."
According to the White House, no other exhibit of this event burdened the taxpayer's wallet.
According to Sikorsky's representative, the company was not involved in the organisation of displaying the helicopter in the south yard.
HMX-1 does not maintain the budget documents of the President's flights, and it is difficult to identify the exact costs of the event.
But according to the annual price of the Ministry of Defence for the financial year 2017, the VH-3D compensation rate is 24 380 dollars per flight hour.
Escader's documents marked the flight from the main base of this basic base from Naval Quantico Airport in both directions for 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using a helicopter is well below this sum.
"Thurning the costs of paying on the basis of the estimated compensation rates is very misleading," Walters said.
"These estimated compensation rates shall include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible costs to be taken into account for annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 RAND study, the compensation rates of the Ministry of Defence do not include personnel costs, but they cover the costs related to fuel, maintenance and contracts.
Sean Spicer, former spokesperson for the White House, defended the use of a helicopter at the event at the time.
"The idea is to show things made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that the state of Sikorsky and Connecticut is very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are supposedly hundreds, if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
So, of course, it is right to highlight it."
It is unclear whether Trump touched the helicopter or not when he was circulating in the south as part of the event, but he sat behind the wheel of the fire truck.
At the White House, Trump approached Sikorsky's representatives, making fun of media outlets about the company's products in his own fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of their products."
Grit Sheadeiko - through tears, peace and joy arrived
At the 2011 World Cup, Sheadeiko hit the last area, a leg crater on a 800-metre run, and the pond was taken away with a gurney from the stadium.
Immediately before that, he had received zero on a universe-steady jump held in China.
The 2012 Helsinki EM was injured in the cheapness, but at the debut Olympics held in London, he took the 23rd place with 6013 points.
However, the failure continued.
At the 2013 Moscow World Cup, the Estonian high-notch injury in the long jump, was on the Estonian high school on the Estonian record after the opening day.
Two years later, he took 15th place at the Beijing World Cup and fulfilled the Olympic standard, but that was more disappointed to the athlete.
Sheadeiko passed the most difficult caddow only last year, if he did not get the result on the long jump in Amsterdam at the beginning.
I'd just like to assemble a decent multi-competition once.
One time," Shiadeiko confessed.
Halvem was still ahead: a month later, his Olympic competition in Rio was interrupted on the first barrier due to a reed.
Time had to be taken down - would the 7th competition continue at all?
Is it worth all this two days' effort?
She thought for a long time, but found peace.
I got to think of my head.
It is relatively difficult to describe this experience, but I have thought that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Luckily, there was time to heal yourself and think of your head.
"I knew I wouldn't put the pills in the bag yet," says Sheadeiko about his self-cleaning.
I got a clean page and move on with a new momentum.
According to Coach Anne Mägi, it was very difficult to look at the suffering of the war, but she realised that, above all, the athlete had to find out himself.
He was so snatched by everyone.
It was hard to take.
"Grit, on the other hand, said he wouldn't give up and he wants to prove to himself what he's worth," Mägi says.
He's got some kind of peace in him.
He's doing it for his pleasure.
Competition went back in May, when Sheadeiko set a new Estonian record of 6280 points in the multi-competition of Götzis.
In a high-level competition, he repaired his personal top brand in the bulletpull in nearly a metre (13.89) and ran into a hurdle of a time close to a record-breaking time.
Then the multi-competitor felt that it was not a ceiling of abilities at all, but was deleted only by a first competition.
Mägi, who instructed him for years, says that Sheadeiko is a model student.
He's ready for an athlete. He's good to train.
If something's wrong or is wrong, he'll say it right away.
He knows his body and trusts his feeling.
That's what we need to do.
I cannot say exactly what needs to be done and we will follow it.
A new approach has also been found in Sheadeiko.
"I'm not the one who makes the most of the most in practice," he says and says that the most important thing is to get the right feeling, because it also ensures a good result.
The baby's happiness of the neares
Good emotions have also been offered happiness to the loved ones.
Both her former training companion Maris Mägi and sister Grete recently became parents and several contestants have received support from new hosts.
"It's been interesting," says Sheadeiko.
One alcohol whose drinking equals the brain "training."
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big wine fan that believes - with wine can train the brain better than in the world with any other things.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
According to him, it is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but in the "very active" process of seasoning wine.
By sniffing the glass, spinning wine, enjoying it and perceives the aftermath, we put our brain to work to create a taste for wine.
According to Sheperd, wine molecules do not actually contain taste, but the taste arises from the way the wine stimulates the brain.
He brings the color of the brain "show" to compare.
"The taste is not in wine, the taste creates a taste of wine," Sheperd says.
Things that still affect the development of the taste of wine are, for example, the age, sex and even the amount of saliva produced by the person.
Sheperd, of course, admonishes that the wine is not to be drunk.
"Theme must be more," he says.
If you take too big limp, the system is oversaturated.
Excessive drinking wine can harm the brain instead of any benefit - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine, memory loss, balance and reduced mental ability are risking.

According to the UN, Afghans democracy depends on the role of women in politics
The head of the UN mission to Afghanistan said on Wednesday that the elections can only represent the people when all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, Head of the UN Assistance Mission, said that hundreds of women are running for local Soviet elections, three women stand as Vice-President, and more than 30 per cent of recently registered voters are women.
"It is not possible to exaggerate the importance of the role of women," he said in a statement made on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The elections and presidential elections of the Afghan local councils will take place on 5 April.
For its part, the Taliban has threatened an election process, which coincides with the transition period, when the role of international military operations becomes acclaimable.
The elections this year will be celebrated for the first time when power is given calmly from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysm, the strong role of women in the success of democracy in Afghanistan is increasing.
According to the Afgency Election Panel, 1.2 million of the voters enrolled in the Afghan independent voter are women.

The world wide from the Philippines, the journey of the world of fashion fans
The bags braided from the guards are summer classics, which have become a separate hit product in recent years, which even has to hang at the top of one of the right summer women and on which merchants have been able to weld an appropriate price tag on the hit despite its modest origin.
The bag braided from the shoulders is probably one of the things that have existed every time in life and with the possession of which has not caused special emotions.
It just exists, and if it's not, there's nothing broken.
Now, however, the shoulder bags are making a real triumph, and fashion fans have changed their fine designer bags for the summer months instead of simple shoulders for bags braided.
At the same time, it is not only a beach bag, but today it is just popular as a street bag and the bravest women even walk into the office.
However, it is worth explaining here before whether such a summer story still sits for the boss or whether it is worth pushing the martyr and the laptop to a slightly more official sudan.
The disparity in the shoulder bags has made the true summer love of women.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing remains to ensure that fashion gourmets are the first thing to retrieve on a holiday trip as the first thing to the local market and buy a shoulder bag to which the whole holiday time will be faithful and which goes with them on the beach, and also with friends in digging on the city.
Some bloggers are so generous that buying larger piles of bags from the market and selling or giving them to their loyal readers.
At the same time, it is worth noting that there is a high demand for readers that in the real world, women (and men!) will probably go after each other in order to become the owner of a happy bag.
In a way, such a madness is also understandable, because they are rare times when it is possible to buy some things in the hit status for just a few dozen euros in fashion world.
True, clever merchants have also discovered a simple possibility of money here, and so finer luxury brands also sell straw bags for a few hundred and thousands of euros.
Probably just because richer customers should not feel easy to be present, who will promense a circle with cheap bags.
For example, you can buy a shoulder bag of Dolce & Gabbana over a thousand euros.
However, Chanel's shoulder bag interpretation can be played around 6,000 euros.
Unlike most fashion giants, the shoulder bags do not come from a few great fashionables, but their story began from farther away.
Namely, the shoulder bags allegedly come from a far from the Philippines, from which they have been discoated.
The reds of the shoulder is, above all, an export business, and local people very often sees it go around with them.
Supposedly, the puplexing technique dates back to the 14th century and is quite a badger with a normal basket.
However, since the shoulder bag does not have to be braided as hard as a basket, the patterns and other materials can be embedded in them, which make the bag more personalizing and also more accentuated by it.
For example, there are recently particularly trendy bags with braids in them with red coloured ribbons or leather strips.
The letter of thanks may first and foremost be the shoulder bags sent to actress Jane Birkin, of whom the biggest braided shoulder bagfkin had never been seen before.
Namely, he was able to fit in the shoulder bag with all sorts of clothing sets and did not even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival much.
However, the popularity of the bags today does not play a smaller role, but also that caring for them is a rooster head and unlike all sorts of other sumadians, do not have to care for them by special means, but also drives the matter by the water and armal.
As always in the case of trending, brands have come up with all sorts of interpretations after classic appearance.
For example, if you wish, you can buy a paired handed arm or a tiny shoulder bag.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that the classic shoulder bag never goes out of fashion, but kerbric queuer rank is never going.
But what is a classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, for centuries, such a bag of shoulders, which resembles the basket from its style, is open from its style and there are short, as well as be shoulder, handles.

GMB concerns investments at McVitie Glasgow factory
The company expects managers of the cookie manufacturer McVitie to confirm the long-term production plans at the Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has remained silent about the future of the investment in Tollcross object.
The factory, which manufactures Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, owner of McVitie, said that they had invested more than GBP 5 million in the last few years.
There were more employees and trade union chairmen "the first to hear" than something changes in the activities of the factory.
In a letter sent to the company's object manager, GMB Scotland turned to McVitie with a request to "discover concerns about the fact that the funding is not used to modernize production lines."
Drew Duffy, Senior Organizer of GMB, said: "The situation that we do not get the object manager revealed on Tollcross's business needs and future investment plan, worry about our members.
Several generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is largely composed of local community and people around Glasgow, being an essential pillar for ensuring proper employment in a region where there is high unemployment and there is a social failure.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wage and well-being in the eastern part of Glasgow and McViti's company with a rapidly growing rate of return on Brexit, the rise in living costs and the chronic decline in production, is desperately effective.
The representative of Plads said: "The object manager of theTollcross was only written from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company responds directly to him, as we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting between the employees and GMB representatives took place in Tollcross, where several problems were discussed openly.
We then discussed with the workers that, like all the other companies active in an extremely competitive and precarious economic climate, we will review our activities on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - to ensure their competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years, we have invested over GBP 5 million of Tollcross object, most of it has gone to production lines and improving operations.
We fully understand the heritage of Tollcross as a production object, and if there are any changes in the activities of the object, the employees and trade union representatives will be the first to hear from it."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about the approach of Neymar three years ago?
La Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up in his quest to attract Neymar to its ranks by offering GBP 189 million to buy him out, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago for this record conquest trip?
This gossip approach has opened the summer transition window, and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the current world record of more than double over again, which was set last season with the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester for GBP 89 million.
Once the transition has been completed, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and also the most highly paid professional athlete in the world, who will receive more than 500,000 pounds a salary from PSG after payment.
Barcelona is known to be angry both because of the way the approach and the free break of Neymar, although a source close to Catalans's management company confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the club since his arrival in Kuressaare in 2013.
But did the President warn the football world of this opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in concluding a contract with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifily warned all clubs who think about recruiting the best player of the PSG.
"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we will stand up to them and contact them with these players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We honor all the clubs.
But if they try to sign a contract with some of our players, they have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this border, as the Spanish club previously showed interest in Marco Verratt, the central field player of the PSG, this summer.
The PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave on any condition and that Barcelona could get a setback as a result of this interest, losing one of its precious assets in Neymar's form.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexit, not borders.
"Brexit is seriously threatened to affect wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland," Varadkar warned Northern Ireland at the first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made the current free movement of people and goods possible, Varadkar said.
"This is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not boundaries," he stressed.
According to Varadkar, he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union, and since it could not be achieved, remaining part of the European common market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain's departure smoother would be the creation of a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, explained the Irish Prime Minister.
Indicating that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "We could definitely have this with Great Britain."
An alternative would be a return to customs points that would declare historical division and a political failure.
"Think trade, prosperity and peace," said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit a "the challenge of our generation" and warned that its result could affect every aspect of the daily life of Northern Ireland.
Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of the main parties of Northern Ireland when visiting Belfast.
