Four members of Kemerovo grouping were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to the Postimees, Slava Gulevich, the head of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in the Estonian underworld in Spain, was detained by the police in the criminal world known as Slava Kemerovski.
Gulevich, detained in Spain, was arrested with the permission of the court.
Yesterday, the court also seized three suspects detained in Estonia into custody.
Suspects are the members of the so-called Kemerovo crime association aged between 27 and 57, who mainly commit drug offences.
In the province of Malaga in Mijas, Spain, the alleged leader of the criminal organisation was detained.
Three men were detained as a suspect in Estonia, one of them is, according to data collected, a leader of the criminal organisation and two are members of a criminal organisation.
The data collected suggest that the criminal organisation was clearly allocated tasks and roles.
The purpose of the criminal association's activities was to commit drug offences and thereby to earn criminal proceeds," commented Vahur Verte, Head of Pre-trial Proceedings, State Prosecutor Vahur Verte.
"We do not rule out the increase of the circle of suspects in this criminal case," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have previously been interested in law enforcement authorities, and some of them have served for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish counterparts has been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us and this week's operation shows the success of the cooperation," commented Attorney Verte.
Ago Leis, Head of the Central Criminal Police Department, said that the detentions were preceded by a pre-examination of nearly a year and a half.
"In the first half of the week, the long-term work was realised and at the same time we detained the suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
Leis added that the officials of the Central Criminal Police were helpful in detention in Spain.
For years, we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the civilian card force.
These detentions are yet another message to the criminals that we can reach them from the other end of Europe," said Leis.
The information collected so far indicates that, while there is a freedom, the men who have been questioned may continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecutor's office requested their arrest and approved it.
A man arrested in Spain awaits his surrender to Estonia.
In this criminal case, immovable property, vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation.
Pre-trial proceedings in the criminal matter are conducted by the Bureau of Organised Crimes of the Central Criminal Police and headed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The City Court of Tallinn convicted Slava Gulevich in 2005 of extortion and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the criminal world of Estonia in the criminal world after Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich from Kemerovo stood out in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s, when he began to deal with blackmail in Tallinn.
Supposedly, he taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at different hotels and demanded a monthly roofing tax from businessmen.
International joint operations, the confiscation of proceeds of crime and the final judgments confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the last judgments, the so-called Dikayev criminal case, eight accused persons separated from the criminal case of the criminal organisation, from whom the proceeds of crime were confiscated 80 000 euros, or a judgment on nine persons in relation to the fact that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal organisation in 2006 aimed at the illegal trade in secret cigars and the commission of crimes related to trafficking in human beings in Ida-Virumaa and South Estonia.
Confiscated proceeds of crime are approximately 71 500 euros there.
In these criminal cases, success has ensured that police officers exchange information and evidence with foreign colleagues every day and, if necessary, acts are carried out in any European Union country.
A citizen's group warns about travelling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri against discriminatory policy and racist attacks.
The statement of the group states: "The NAACP travel note issued for the State of Misssour, valid until 28 August 2017, invites all African-American passengers, visitors and misogues to be particularly attentive and extremely cautious when moving around the state, taking into account the whole number of dubious racial events that have been brought across the state and also brought here.
According to the NAACP, the group was encouraged by the recent Missouri law, which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination, as well as the fact that the targets of the state's law enforcement personnel are unequally largely minorities.
"People's rights are violated.
They are drawn to the edge of the road because of their skin color, beaten or killed," said Rod Chapel, President of the Missouri Branch of the NAACP, to The Kansas City Star.
"We've never been so closely complained before."
This is the first warning issued by an organization about the state of the United States.
The group referred to events such as racist insults to black students at the University of Missouri and the death of the 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in the beginning of this year after he ran out of gasoline bypassing the state, and the Missouri P.D. police took him into custody without being accused of a crime.
In addition, the note refers to a recent report by the Attorney General of Missouri, which shows that in the state, black drivers' cars are 75% more likely to be stopped than those of white people.
"The note is designed to be aware of people and to warn their families, friends and fellows about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be prepared, whether it is to involve bail money or to inform relatives that they will pass through the state."
According to the latest data from the FBI's report of hate crimes, 100 hate crimes were documented in 2015 in Missouri, which places the state in terms of similar violations in the 16th place in section of the country.
The travel warning is also in response to the new law of Missouri, which makes it difficult for the company to sue for discrimination in search of housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel notes on Texas and Arizona after these states passed immigration laws that ordered local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, as ACLU says it would increase racial profiling.
Usually, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issues travel warnings about other countries, but recently, interest groups have begun to use this measure as a counter-reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Hepatitis: what could anyone know about the different forms of this serious illness?
Hepatitis or liver inflammation may be caused by five hepatitis virus A, B, C, D and E.
All of these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, with a poor medical cost, hepatitis B and C is chronic, which can further develop into liver cirrhosis, i.e. wrinkles of the liver and liver cancer.
The epidemiology counsellor of the Health Board Kuulo Kutsar says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same in all types of inflammation of the liver - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, greyish stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
The latter is also the subject of the disease, the popular name jaundice of liver inflammation.
In children, hepatitis may be without any signs of disease.
Different types of liver inflammation can only be determined on the basis of laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can be transferred to chronic hepatitis and run for decades without signs of disease, which means that a person may not know anything about his dangerous liver-damaging disease.
Kuulo Kutsar highlights the various forms of hepatitis and describes their course in more detail.
Hepatitis A viruses are spreading from a sick person and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, sex, the faeces of an infected person's hands and hands from food, surfaces, objects, blowjobs and drug consumption.
A patients with hepatitis infection, i.e. the family members and caregivers of the patient at risk, people with chronic liver diseases, people having sex with the infected person, men who have sex with men, drug addicts, and passengers visiting the high-spreading countries of hepatitis A.
Infection can be prevented by vaccination, in particular vaccination for many people at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to meet the daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands, wash all fruit and vegetables before food use.
Hepatitis B viruses are transmitted when exposed to the blood of a patient, injecting drugs, tattooing, piercing, blood-contaminated household items (toothb rubbish, shaving agents), donor blood, sex with a suspect person of hepatitis, sex from the mother to the fetal/invasive person.
B is part of the risk of hepatitis infection, injectable drug addicts, infected person sex partners, men having sex with men, newborns of an infected mother, sick family members and caregivers, health care, rescue workers and police officers in contact with blood and other body fluids, and passengers visiting countries with high disease of hepatitis B.
It is possible to vaccinate people for the prevention of hepatitis B; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk, as well as persons with chronic liver diseases, HIV-infected, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetics.
Other preventive measures of hepatitis B are: refraining from the use of sanitary and manicure equipment, other cereals and needles, tattooing and piercing, and the use of condom in case of infectious sex or the prevention of sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation plan and children free of charge in Estonia.
Hepatitis C viruses are transmitted when a sick person is exposed to blood, injecting drugs, tattooing, piercing, blood-contaminated domestic objects, donor blood, sex with a suspect person and from a person with a suspect person from the mother to the fetal/subject to the fetus.
Hepatitis C-infected drug addicts, infected person sex partners, men who have sex with men, newborns of the infected mother, sick family members and caregivers, health care personnel and police officers in contact with blood and other body fluids, persons with HIV infection, and passengers visiting high-age patients with hepatitis C.
C prevention measure of hepatitis is: refraining from the use of sanitary and manicure equipment, other cereals and needles, tattooing and piercing, and the use of condom in case of suspected infections.
C no vaccinees against hepatitis.
Hepatitis D is caused by hepatitis D virus, which reproduces in the presence of hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D is present in patients with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses are transmitted in contact with blood and other body fluids, with contaminated syringes and needles, sexually and rarely infected from the mother to the foetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and people not having immunity to hepatitis B.
Effective prevention measure is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from hepatitis D virus infection.
E hepatitis viruses are transmitted by fecal-oral way with drinking water and food, including low heat-treated beef, fish and clams, donor blood, shared syringes and infected mother to the foetus.
Passengers may be infected with E in high-disease countries.
E prevention measures include filling the hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after walking in the toilet, before cooking and eating, after care for the patient.
Wash fruit and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating low heat-treated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug consumption.
Although in the last round, the competitors tried to get out of the path four times the Olympic winner, 34-year-old Farah found strength at the end and won with 26.49.51.
Farah didn't think for a long time, pulling his wife Tania and the children along with him after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
Being on the track with them was wonderful," Farah said to the journalists.
Farah is aiming for a golden double of 5,000 and 10,000 meters in a row in London.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "The Lady in Gold, Gustav Klimt's Masterpiece, The Architect of the Port of Adele Bloch-Bauer," will be much deeper from the history of the birth of one of the works of art in Vienna's early and early 20th century.
But even more in history.
The arousing amount of information would have been useful, i.e. a harder cutter axe, a narrower theme, to have been blown up in the title, the extraordinary story of the portrait.
At present, there are two books between one of the covers: Gustav Klimt and his painting "Daam in gold" the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, as well as a much more extensive history book about the esteemed Jewish families and the German occupation in Austria.
The first third of the book takes the cultural life of Vienna, which is in the middle of the bubbling life in the middle of the Austrian capital, and he himself, it can be for the slightest time to imagine how life to the Ringstra was going around the Ringstra, or how everyone turned to the cafe of Central when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of Europe's richest cities and, when you see the name you know in the book, you feel like a gram more cultural.
At the same time, the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where the proliferation in the uninforgettable syphilis and was the highest level of suicide in Europe, as if there was nothing to do with the development of the story.
Or perhaps - every paired bliss brush stroke adds colours to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
A Dream out of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had grown explodingly, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
Almost every tenth resident of Vienna was a Jew at the turn of the century.
Adele's parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married Ferdinand Bloch, the Czech sugar magnate, and Klimt had his father's bank in the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adelet's whole glamorous life he belonged to didn't pull.
When you look at "Lamme gold," it's hard to believe that towards the end of life this magnificent lady was infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order a portrait of his wife from Klimt, the last moment was the hottest painter in Vienna.
The order of the klimbing cost 4000 kroons at the time, a quarter of the price of a country house with a good location.
The fact that in some portraits, the master's love story with the model was not deterred by the sugar magnate.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only certain fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist, which was created in the course of the work, continued for the rest of his life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "The Lady in Gold.
The extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer," Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Just before the work with Adele, Klimt had been to Ravenna's San Vita in the Basilica, and the investigators think that the brilliant mosaics I Empress Theodorast gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adele as a painting of Adele.
Klimt presented his "Ladme gold" in Vienna in 1908 and at about the same time (from 1907 to 1984) another golden painting "Stone."
Art historians did not miss the similarity of two women.
What about the story, Hitler?
"I think I owe him a debt to commemorate my friend Klimt to make his handiwork available to the public," Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after the artist's departure (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wished that the Klimt collection of their family would go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimti had another portrait of Adele.
In his will (Adele left in February 1925), he also asked his wife to leave his two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscape paintings to the Austrian Gallery.
His jewellery bequeathed him to his niece Maria and Luis.
A year after Klimt had graduated from "Austria Mona Lisa," 17-year-old Adolf Hitler had attempted to get to the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, but failed the draw exam.
Although sometimes Hitler's subsequent anti-Semitism is considered to be the reason for the fact that Jewish professors did not receive him to the academy, none of his examiners was actually Jewish.
In any case, the task of the Austrian Gallery, cited in Maria's will, had become significant for 1939 - the rich Jewish art collections in Vienna had become important to find works for the Nazi party.
Hitler's personal art museum also matched some of Adele's homework, but not Klimt's.
Sixty years after the Nazi art abduction, a ten-year dispute between the Austrian government and the heirs of Bloch-Baers began.
It should only be noted that if "Sonness" sees in Belvedere Castle in Vienna, the "Lamserve of the Lady" depicts Adele Bloch-Bauer must take a look at the Neue Galerie of New York.
And before the Vienna race, read the above-mentioned book.
Even if you don't plan to go to Klimt's work, because at least my emotions revolved more around Nazi and Jewish theme than the painting sold for the USD 135 million and model Adele Bloch-Bauer.
So not so much a portrait, rather than the story of the family's fate - and a very touching story.
In events, the Bauer family tree, which was noted at the beginning of the book, facilitated orientation.
A 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In the squeal, Gold was very close to his own 200 m spinning personal record by swimming 2.16,62.
The top brand dates back to 17 years ago a week ago, when the Canadian Junior Championship was awarded by 2.16,58, Priit Aavik Floating mediates.
Gold was the last one, the tenth to the final.
In the finals, he passed the distance with time 2.15,76 and achieved a good seventh place with a new powerful top stamp.
From the Estonian record (2.15.13) owned by Alina Kendzior, Gold remained a little over half a second.
In Estonia's all-time rankings, Gold became third and his fresh personal top brand is the fifth ever Estonian score.
The young hope of the future is still taking off in 100 m, 200 m and 400 m free swimming and 200 m and 400 m complex swimming in the Canadian adult championship.
Last week, there were a Canadian Junior Championship in Toronto, and Gold also made successful start there.
He won a silver medal in 200 m free swimming with the time of 2.03,22.
This distance was last burned by the Estonian woman in 2008.
More quickly than Gold throughout the ages, only the Estonian record-finding agent Elina Partõka has swim swimming in Estonia.
The Estonian woman living in Canada also won a bronze medal in 100 m free swimming with a great personal record and the top brand of the new Estonian season 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, a year older than him, has only swim one century faster.
He reached the personal top mark in the opening exchange of the message swimming for another 100 m on his back.
On a longer distance, he only won seventh place when he swam in the finals 2.17,31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season rankings on four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics sharpen their teeth
The time for vacations is here - it means relaxation for the President of the United States, Donald Trump.
However, since Trump has been one of the president's most holiday days so far, critics are already sharpening their teeth.
According to U.S. Today and CNN, the President is planning to spend a 17-day holiday at the Bedminster Golf Club in New Jersey.
Although the president's holiday began yesterday, Trump's opponents have been speaking on the holiday for a week.
They're giving Trump too often rest.
Namely, it is customary for the president to spend time in his Florida, Virginia and New Jersey villas on weekends.
By the way, Trump is not the most rested president during his 196 office days.
For example, George W. Bush was on vacation for 67 days, but Barack Obama was half as low as Trump, but only 21 days.
But Trump tends to forget things fast.
The days counted after becoming president Trump said on "60 minutes" that there will be no time for long vacations during his term of office, as there is a great deal to be done.
He also expressed his resentment at Barack Obama's holiday three years ago.
The current President wrote on Twitter at the time: "As Obama is on vacation, playing golf, attending parties and jazz concerts, ISIS chops the heads off by journalists."
According to the White House officials, a 17-day visit to the golf club is not quite a relaxation.
This is officially called a work leave during which Trump does not have time for reading or other favourite activities.
In addition, there had to be another reason on the leave.
Namely, the turbo conditioning system is replaced in the west wing of the White House and therefore all personnel had to leave.
In the west there is also the Oval Cabinet and other Presidential premises.
"I don't think any of you would want to be in the west wing in August, if there are 38 degrees and there is no air conditioning," said Lindsay Walters, the White House spokesperson, who stressed that the President will continue to work during the holiday.
About where President Trump spends the next 17 days, you get an idea of the video.
Blocking Critics from Facebook - Do not stand as a state agency if you do not tolerate the criticism of voters
The father of our country knew a lot about unfavourable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long to beat him up for everything from internal politics to his political principles.
Criticism, of course, upset him.
But he didn't make his critics remain silent.
Because in 1783, Washington said that "freedom of the word could be taken from us, and in mute and in silence, we could be led to carnages like sheep."
It brings me to Larry Hogan, Governor of Maryland, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates have blocked and deleted posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.
And to the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued him.
The governor's official stamped the action in vain, and the web commentaries were filled with counter-reactions in the style "Who interests?"
"It's just Facebook," many said.
But that does.
And it counts especially when it's a man like Hogan.
It is an amazingly popular Republican governor in the democratic state.
His approval percentage is the second best among the 50 governors in the country.
Hogan is not a reactive numb head.
He has led the state on a solid hand and remained strictly firm in his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook as the main tool in communicating with his electorate, for example, presenting his balstaly after chemotherapy for the first time.
Thus, the Governor's page - which is an official public forum, managed by staff receiving taxpayers' dollars in dollars - blocking people visiting people is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan's spokesman, Amelia Chasse, defended the behaviour of the governor in an interview with The Washington Post, claiming that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of online cables, spammers or a people full of anger.
The Post talked to several real people Hogan blocked.
And that's exactly what they are people who communicate with their chosen managers, the teacher, the owner and the pastor, not the Internet trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not filthy at all.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, oppressing Hogan's Catholicism.
A lawyer from Maryland Bowie, Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, did not incite anger, but about real hate crimes.
"I politely found that I am disappointed because he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in The Post's commentary state.
"I also do not like the idea that how many people comment on the same topic, some call it indifferently collective effort, rather than admitting that they are a large number of citizens."
What the governor's official called a "directed spam attack," would probably call "public support."
The Facebook-era allows you to easily match messages by simply blocking a critic or by deleting a negative comment.
It's much cleaner than it used to be sent out by the workers to do the same, so that they would collect newspapers with critical editorials and burn them, or arrest the protesters, and forced them to remain silent.
But that's exactly what's going on right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first state official to be criticised for making Facebook and other social media channels toothless.
President Trump has sued Twitter users who have been blocked from his Twitter stream.
One of the first judgments of significant meaning on the subject was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris decided in Alexandria that the chairwoman of Loudoun County's Oversight Board violated the first amendment of the Constitution when he blocked the voter from his Facebook page.
In Kentucky, for the use of Facebook and Twitter, ACLU also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R).
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington, affordable mail costs had a similar impact than the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, a number of newspapers and anonymous writers hurled his way of management.
And even then, Washington had to face with the anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to the newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making Washington decisions to the ground.
According to historical documents collected in the framework of the online collection of George Washington's letter collection project, his Cabinet was buried under petitions, which criticised his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with the United Kingdom.
But he didn't make them shut up.
Freedom of expression, disagreements and debates are the foundations of our country.
And proper leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for the comfort of the home territory at the Renaissance Club
Former European number Ronan Rafferty hopes for the convenience of the territory of the home territory in the next three days when the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place on the golf courses of the East Lothiani Renaissance Club.
The Northern Irishman, who was in charge of the last round on the neighbouring Archerfield Links trails last year before the oath of Paul Eales, is fond of the new venue and fills the role of a member of the tournament instead of Jerry Sarvad, the founder and CEO of the club.
"I saw the Renaissance Club be built and now we see how the club will shine in full glory with this event," Rafferty said.
"Players see the path in their best shape, it is in a glorious state.
Jerry has done an excellent job of building this place.
He is an avid supporter of golfing and is proud of what he has achieved here.
It allows you to present the trail perfectly."
Inglane Eales is looking forward to being able to defend the championship for the first time, even though he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"It is accompanied by a very special feeling," said a player nesting in Southport.
"I couldn't defend my Extremadura Open title because it was taken out of the competition a year after my victory.
It's magical to come back to this neighborhood.
It's a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, for me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory was special.
It was a very special time that we will always bear in our hearts.
Gary Orr, who joined the European tour of mushrooms, will return to the beginning of the year when he received 50.
He is his first event in Scotland after his participation in Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"To play at home is always a bit more meaningful," said the Helensburgh man Orr.
"You want to perform well, but you also feel extra voltage.
I've enjoyed playing again and showing quite a good golf game.
I'm satisfied with the progress of things so far."
The trio will be joined by former Masters Tournament winner Ian Woosnam and the mushroom tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of six Scots in the competition, the rest being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entrance is free of charge and parking with one passenger costs 5 pounds per car and 10 pounds for a car with two or more passengers.
All income goes to Prostate Cancer UK charity.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's gold painting
If Bardina's Degei dinner is made, he won't use the stove.
He rarely uses the pot.
In a wooden house in the wooden house in Enarotali, the reluctant province of Papua province of Indonesia, the housewife places a batad called a notary directly on the fireplace.
In half an hour, the charred tuber is taken from the fire and eagerly put on the skin with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor - furniture he has no furniture, and there he does his daily chores, for example, washing with blurred water from a nearby bog.
The role of the toilet is played by a bucket in a roofless room.
Since he is the youngest of four of his wife's wives, he is not destined to take care of any field.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late, however, can be dangerous - most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them are drinking hard, and there are also soldiers here.
"Nobody dares to visit after 5 o'clock in the evening," he says.
It is a rare glimpse of the Papua Highlands, which was merged under Indonesia in 1969 after a referendum that caused controversy, forced only 1026 elderly people to vote in front of the eyes of the occupant troops.
The movement, which has instigated the liberation of the Dutch people, quickly directed its rage against the government of Jakarta, which still keeps the region under its strong control, keeping away from foreign journalists and human rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially distributed to Paapua and West Paapua, so that the eastern part of the island remained on the independent Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is a distant and abandoned place in the same way, and to get to this place, you have to fly from the capital of the province to Jayapure for 90 minutes to Nabire and then have to go through a five-hour journey that makes you nause with a rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered wavy iron roofs, the rust of which has turned different tones into yellowish-brown.
Very few Indians have taken the journey here, not to mention journalists, nor have there been any foreigners here at all.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, Mee Pago worshipped the god Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wearing such clothes," says Degei, referring to his color-killed turban, dark blouse and vivid skirt.
"Before we wore only plant leaves on the body."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line, and statistics on infant mortality and illiteracy are one of the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's gold-filled land.
Just 100 km from Pania, a mountainous province of approximately 170,000 inhabitants, is the world's largest and most profitable gold mine, owned by Freeport McMoran, a Phoenix company operating in Phoenix.
In 2015, Freeport extracted about USD 3.1 billion worth of gold and copper in 2015, worth about USD 3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua can boast of supplies of commercial goods, with an estimated USD 78 billion.
But these wealths are the source of sinpute suffering, as they result in the suffocating presence of the powerful Indonesian army.
A 2005 study by The New York Times showed that Freeport paid approximately USD 20 million to local military personnel and military units from 1998 to 2004, including up to USD 150,000 for one officer.
Panpuas aspirations to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and they are mercilessly handled.
According to human rights activists, more than 5000,000 padapuas have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killing of the Papua tribes in the mountainous lands of the 1970s was the size of genocide.
Last year alone, more than 3900 peaceful protesters were arrested by the Indonesian police in the area.
The 2016 report of the Archdiocese of Birsbane's "We're losing All" contains testimonies of the atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (as stated in one of the other reports, rape and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations are particularly common.
"The number of victims is difficult to count, as such incidents occur every week," says Andreas Harsono, researcher of Indonesia Human Rights Watch.
The screws have been turned more strongly, as Papua's natural resources have caused the influx of new settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians, but demographics are changing, as the Muslim economic migrants arrive from the islands of Jaava, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawes from the people of Indonesia.
Jaavaiards sell gulls with crispy chickens and mixed vegetables gado-gado, which are served with peanut sauce.
The locals can't compete with them.
"Migrants began to sell chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local moms," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old born in Paniai, who moved to Jayapura, the capital of the province for work.
"Pirable Pajapua - the mama of the papua-ma's [women] - are therefore losing their market share."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who is known among the people as Jokowi, promised to deal with these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua in his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter won 27 of the 29 constituencys of Papua, including Paniai, on his way to Jakarta's presidential palace.
But Papua has changed very little and the locals feel deceitful.
"Our hearts are broken, because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in anticipation that he would meet our hopes for the restoration of justice," says You.
In fact, only two months after Jokowi took office in a low position two months after Jokowi took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children sang Christmas songs at the fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle from darkness.
The surviving children told them they should turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, drunken soldiers chased children and beat them with their gun handles.
Then one of the soldiers shot among the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby electoral commission building was set on fire, and the next day things escalated even more.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered in demand for justice on a football field in front of the local police station and military command centre.
They wore ceremonial hunting vibes and presented Papua's pago tribe's waita dance, during which they ran around and buried in a bird song.
Some protesters started throwing rocks at the police and the military.
"If the crowd points more than three resistors, they were told to the soldiers by exacerbating the attack. "If the crowd is more than three times, let them down," was said according to the official document, which has been seen by the magazine TIME, but which has not been issued to local media outlets.
Yeremias Kayame (56), the elder of the city of Enarotali, Kego Koto, sensed the threat and called for peace, asking the crowd to go home.
No one had a way to hear it.
"When I turned the rebuilt, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist," he told the magazine TIME in his vivid colours on the porch porch house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he says that the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers.
"There was a lot of people, there were plenty of shots," he adds.
The local man, Alfius Youw, was hit three times, according to his cousin who saw him shooting.
"I went to him and studied his body to make sure he was," said Yohanes, who uses only one name like many Indians.
"I saw him dead... kissed him."
Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told the reporters that his subordinates were only back to the security of his precinct because it was attacked.
"We need to defend ourselves if we are threatened to be killed," said Patea Police spokesman, Commissar Pudjo Sulistyo, spokesperson for Papua.
"This is a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The news of the killings reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi Jayapura gave a passionate speech, where he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the abuses in Papuua.
"I want to solve this case immediately so that it never again will again," he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he would establish an out-of-court mechanism for the settlement of crimes against human rights.
But almost immediately the apologies followed.
"Most crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The thing is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes," he said.
However, when he spoke to TIME on 5 June in Jakarta, Wiranto took his words back, saying that he had no intention of creating a mechanism for dealing with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said that "everything will be resolved by law."
Wiranto, who has been accused by the United Nations of crimes against human rights in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the 1999 bloody independence referendum, said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been solved in Papua, including what happened in Pania.
The families of the victims of Paniai accepted such claims with a gloomy mistrust.
"I have been interrogated four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired. "
He says he's still living in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'm gonna be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed his opinion that the people of Paniai are afraid of dissecting this incident.
He said he got beaten up by the army after he had helped bury four victims.
"After burying the bodies, the army came to look for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police villagers shot in the neighbouring rule of Paniai in Deiya.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, when they went into warfare between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to transport an unconscious man to the hospital.
This male, a 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned in a fish in an near-by river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested at the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers were throwing police officers with stones, on which the latter responded with warning shots.
But locals claim the mobile brigade (Indonesia military police) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
"We were in a big panic, we are afraid of revenge," said Dominggu Badii, 29-year-old, to the magazine, who lives near the hospital and saw the injured in the innate.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
Deiya's Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police concerned and the withdrawal of the police's mobile brigade from the region.
Paniai has always been a problematic place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of thoughtless development feeds the dissatisfaction of honey, moni, dani and the Adamali tribes living in Papua's degrading central mountain land.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL) - the army of rebels, which, according to itself, protects the rights of the pajapuas by organising occasional attacks and kidnapping raids among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the leaders of VPL come from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, under the pretext of "protection of the sovereignty of the country," the army has arrested Pania in recent years and had arbitrarily detained thousands of people.
Some of them never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, the Panias are known as a "tragic forgotten place."
Poverty nourishes discontent.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals to buy.
The bread is the same unavailable.
People grow all their food themselves - mainly batte, plus a little fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can maintain four or five batte fields.
They usually keep most of the yields to the family, the rest sell on the local market.
Ten batets cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between the indigenous pajapuas and the new migrants who have arrived in many ways since the opening of new routes at Nabire Airport have deepened.
These few jobs that exist go better to educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua themselves often lacks capital or necessary skills to conduct a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying, because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Council of Paniai tribes.
Separation keeps the world's eyes away from Papuva.
In addition, foreign media remain severe restrictions.
In the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Paapua because "they did not follow relevant practices," although they had been given a rare film permit.
Phelim Kine, Deputy Head of the Asian Department of Human Rights Watch, said that Jokowi's election promises have not been implemented to lift the restrictions on reports to promote transparency and development.
"The most economic turtic provinces of Papua and West Paapua are threatened with new threats to make reports - the rejection of the visa and the inclusion of a blacklist," he said in the statement.
The lack of a caged look in the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the close neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States, Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate "multi-wide crimes" in Papua, including the shooting of Paniai.
These same countries have historically supported VPL.
Arrmanatha Nasir, spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, rejected the accusations of the group, saying to Jakartas to journalists: "Indonesia still has democratic order and freedom of the press, so that the evidence of cases against human rights would be difficult to bury."
Local people want more foreign governments to be noticed.
When the Dutch official delegation, led by the human rights ambassador of the country, Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local people interrupted their silence, according to the source who had been at the meeting, but wanted to remain anonymous, asking for: "We want freedom."
In Indonesia, new presidential elections will take place in 2019, but the padapuas do not believe that they will vote again for Jokow.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Paniai," says Hobai, Chairman of the Council of the tribes.
He wants to tell Jokow that, in addition to the fact that the people of Paniai live under the threat of a predatory army, they are struggling with misery because of the poorness of poorness and health services.
According to Gobai, Paniai people, like other fences, consider their vote given to Jokwi as a debt that she has to pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting victims of Paniai were able to cope with the last symbolic rebellion - they buried the body of one of the victims in the country opposite the police station and the land opposite the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be put on his feet, at least they will not let the responsible people forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus with his head.
"What else can we do?"
The fire swallowed the Dubai Torch skyscraper for the second time.
The fire swooped through one of the tallest residential towers in the world in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to escape this 337-metre-high and 79-storey building.
This is the second fire that has devastated a high-ranking player in just two years, which is called Torch or Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct cause of the fire was reported.
"We slept and woke up to the fire alarm and the people scream.
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said Reuters, one of the people who called himself George.
According to Dubai civil defence officials, firefighters erased the flame at about 4 a.m. in the morning of the local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to guarantee shelter to the victims.
This incident can once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the external surface of high buildings around the world.
During the investigation carried out after the fire of the board of Turnch in 2015, it was found that the most damage suffered from the facade cover - decorative panels and insulation on the outer surface.
The British police have said that they believe that the isolation and facade panels of the Grenfell Tower of London could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire there in June, in which approximately 80 people were killed.
See: these phones will probably become a winner in the fall
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for technical fans, as phone manufacturers will publish their new top models.
In the spring, Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium were on sale, and new hit phones are expected for the stores in the autumn.
According to Kristjan Seema, Marketing and Sales Director of Tele2, this year's flagship is characterised by innovative design, iris scanner, 4K resolution display and ultra-fast processor.
The Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the top of the Estonian smartphone sales ranking, created a great excitement in the world of technology.
Autumn allows smart lovers to even agile quick charging, more durable battery, a higher quality camera and greater water and dust resistance.
He added that, according to rumors, one can already make assumptions and predict four top models that would probably conquer this year's sales rankings.
These four top models of smartphones will reach the supermarkets in the autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach the store counters already in mid-September.
Rumors of what the new Apple model looks like and what you can do with it, there's a lot of it.
If iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences next to iPhone 6s, Apple's tenth birthday is expected to be completely distinguished from the previous ones.
There are four colours: black, white, pink gold and chrome.
One of the elements of the new design is probably a screen covering the entire front panel of the phone, the lost home button and the fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
Apple's design manager JonyIve requires the new iPhone model to look like a smooth glass.
There has been talk of the ceramic version of iPhone.
In addition to the iris scanner, wireless charging and even more high-quality camera, the A11 processor can be expected to be faster.
I'm sure it's one year of more anticipated smartphones.
Pre-order of the brand new Galaxy Note 8 starts on August 23.
There have been many rumors that the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
I hear it's even more for a business user, and S Pen allows even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one wide-angle and the other a telephoto with a narrower field of view.
At present, no one knows what two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, Samsung is the first test that is definitely comparable to iPhone 8.
Let's wait for August 23rd.
Although Nokia has launched three smartphones led by Nokia 6 this year, their flagship Nokia 8 is still missing, which will be presented already on 16 August.
We expect a 5.6-inch screen from Nokia to edge-to-by-by-by-by-by-step Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and a more durable battery.
Nokia is also discussed in the case of aluminium housing and the considerable degree of water and dust resistance IP68.
Like Samsung, Nokia has two rear cameras with the optics produced by Zeiss.
If Sony has been a solid flagship so far XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones will be added in the near future, with even more innovative features.
We look forward to a smartphone, which is a bit more modest than XZ Premium, but with at least the same good or better camera.
Sony's new model has been speculated that its screen is at least six inches.
What the reality brings can be seen very soon, because traditionally, Sony has published its autumn flagship at the IFA, which will take place this year until 1st to 6 September.
According to the transcripts leaked phone calls, Trump put pressure on Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The Washington Post unveiled the cross-checks of phone calls between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, Trump went to a phone call to the President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, to stop making public proclaim that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of America cried with him for the public condemnation of the wall, saying, "You must not say it to the press."
Trump set up his presidential campaign on the promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and swore that it would make Mexico pay for this project.
Trapts were also published about his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which reveals a tense debate.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States of America would take on the refugees heading to Australia is "naustable," "fashioned" and "rubber." He claimed that the agreement made under Obama's government would give him the impression of "services" as he had proposed a ban on resettlement in the United States.
Trump stopped calling Turnbull that "the doing was the most unpleasant speech of the day."
The Supreme Court did not hear the complaint of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid in the case where the city of Tartu rejected their tender for the procurement of bus services from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a directive that rejected the offer of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid in Tartu bus procurement, as the offer did not meet the requirements, Anneli Apuhtin, the head of Tartu City Government Legal Service, explained.
It is a procurement of public bus transport within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
The city of MRP Leones appealed to the Supreme Court judgment of Tartu District Court.
The Supreme Court did not accept it.
Although on social media, many complain that the noise from the Weekend festival disturbs their nightning and the whole city is full of drunken partyers, there are also many who do not have any bad words to say about the festival on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised that the party was so polite in the store!
I didn't see any blurs or rudeness.
I even saw my kindness," says the Persian Waine.
"It's great that people come, be, are happy to be, are happy and are happy to be in Pärnu, which is like a winter sauna in winter," he adds joyfully.
A dull walet wolf sleep on the beach doesn't bother.
While living in downtown, he still heard that music was played on the beach, now the music hasn't reached his home warfare yet.
"But I hope I hear you," he says joyfully.
Agnes, who also spoke to Õhtuleht, also says that the big festival is rather good for Pärnu - it helps to the turnover of local merchants.
He also rejoices that so many countrymen have come to visit the summer capital.
The woman of the party melu will not interfere.
Although I'm not gonna sunbathe on the beach anymore, but I'm glad the beach has lived.
And it's nice that the people are moving and it's been like this three times," she says.
The first time, I guess it was a little worse.
"Then there were complaints," he contemplates.
However, he says that the sea on the beach is common for the summer chiefs.
"This Weekend is a very good promo for our little city," says Harri, basin in the park.
Melu and action haven't hit his life in the ass.
What about what?!
We should all stick together.
Think of how this inter-national communication would be better.
The man of Loud music is not devastated.
It doesn't bother, even though I live right there.
"Good people can save and there's no trouble," he says.
According to him, guests from Pärnu are polite.
"At the time, they have exaggerated with the flowers, of course, but the young are young and Lord God - let go, but be people and we can do it!" he says.
The coastal residents have travelled away by then, either to relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival affects life positively - people like this kind of boogie," says Tiina, who walked with children in Pärnu.
His family's sleep does not disturb the festival music either, although last year it came even further from this year.
Last summer the stage was the other way around, then we heard more.
We live out of town that it actually sounds quite well by the river Pärnu," he says.
Pearson cuts more than 3000 jobs and reduces dividends to revive business
On Friday, the British educational company Pearson said that it would cut another 3,000 jobs and reduce its intermediate dividends by 72 percent, thereby launching another restructuring programme to solve the risk of business.
Lost jobs, which, according to CEO John Fallon, are most likely to be brought to 4,000 posts lost during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced in May a plan to cut costs by a further GBP 300 million (USD 394 million) under the third cost reduction programme to try to revive a business that has been hit by a rapid digital transition.
The company, which agreed to sell last month's shareholding in Penguin Random House to its partner company Bertelsmann, said that their expectation in connection with the year had not changed since the 1 percent increase in sales revenue to GBP 2,05 billion in the first half of the year.

Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in a suicide attack
According to officials, the suicide bomber attacked military convoys in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several other.
The NATO statement said that five soldiers and interpreters were injured.
Unconfirmed local reports claimed that three civilians were killed in an incident in Qarabagh District.
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence that has hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in the Herat Mosque attack.
On Monday, a suicide bomber in Kabul, near the Iraqi embassy, killed two people.
NATO statement said that the Thursday evening explosion took place when the joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with "man-made self-made explosive device."
According to the application, everyone is injured in a stable condition and is being treated at the U.S. Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to the correspondents, the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (ISIS), the ever-growing force in Qarabagh is a serious source of concern for the forces in Qarabagh, NATO Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which approximately 20% in the capital city.
At the end of July, the car bomb in Kabul was killed mainly by at least 30 people in the Shiite district.
Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, a major bomb attack in the city centre killed more than 150 people - the most deaths resulted in a military attack in the country since the U.S.-led forces repelled the Taliban from power in 2001.
This violence underlines an uncertain security situation in Afghanistan, while the President of the United States, Donald Trump, is considering whether to increase the number of US troops helping the country's army and the police.
According to the correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public crisis of confidence against the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA annulled the suction order after the summing order.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (United States Environmental Protection Agency - EPA) annulled the decision to delay the introduction of the Obama-time regulation, which obliges the states to limit the smog-causible emissions, one day after 15 states sued the Agency's course of its course.
EPA announced its decision to continue with "2015 ozone detection activities" late Wednesday, saying that it demonstrates its commitment to cooperation with the States.
"We believe that we need to conduct and listen to dialogue with our state partners," said Scott Pruitt, head of EPA, in his statement.
Pruitt had announced in June of 1988 EPA's intention to postpone ozone concentration determinations - during which the smog pollution is measured in different parts of the country in order to determine where its level should be reduced to a stricter air quality standard - one year further to October 2018.
15 mainly democratic states brought an action together with the District of Columbia on Tuesday, saying that this decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has attempted to withdraw a number of environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama, which, according to Trump, it is part of a more comprehensive plan of economic growth.
But these aspirations have led to counter-reactions among democrats and nature conservation groups who are concerned about the increased impact of contaminants on human health.
The EPA website states that the inhalation of ozone-containing air "may deplete lungs and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases," such as asthma.
German pigs can have a party.
German pigs and cattle can have a party, as heavy rains threaten the harvest of the second largest wheat producer in the European Union, writes Bloomberg.
This year you can go that weeks of raining before harvesting may mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry is only suitable for animals.
"The quality of wheat is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015," said Bernhard Chilla, analyst of Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 per cent of German wheat may become animal feed, which is double compared to normal, predicted Agravis.
German farmers, like their European counterparts, have been in contact with all forms this year.
The winter was first too dry.
Then came a cold spring, which in June replaced the heat wave.
In July, Germany was hit by rain attacks, which has continued in August.
Many eyes are turned to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvesting.
So far, only five per cent of wheat has been harvested.
Most of the area has not even begun the harvest yet, the local harvest buyer in Ceravis reported.
"There are quite difficult days," said Ceravis' senior trader Frank Deckert from Rendsburg.
Consistency in everything, i.e. the cunning of the interior design of Finns
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the fair homes, as through large windows the wonderful views of Saimaa shores reach many (life) rooms.
At every step, the attempt of our northern neighbours to create both crisper and perfect (energy-efficient) homes will notice.
The knowledge of the wood used by Finns as building and finishing material, furniture and beauty, is worth doing for us.
Agitated techniques and smart solutions can be found in fair houses by both the builder and (home) designer.
It is clear that the combinations of black, white and grey shadows, when they are supplemented by wood tones and house plants, can be very spirited.
Good ideas can be picked for another week, as the trade fair will last until 13 August.
Accessories and herb pots suggest that this kitchen is often cooked.
The night against today, the Weekend Festival Baltic was underlined, and Martin Garrix gave everything on the main stage to remember as the last performer.
During Garrix's performance, the crowd was really twisted - they sang, snooped, danced selflessly.
When Garrix stopped, the same mass was drained from Pärnu beach to the city.
We'll bring you a gallery with all the photos our photographer caught on the Weekend in three days.
I'm sure you're in one of them, too, find yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to face up to the most enticing boxing match in the near future weight category up to 67.7 kg, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in the ESPN office in Los Angeles in separate rooms, up to Garcia, an invincible World Boxing Council lightweight championship, walked across the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's featherweight championship.
After the victory achieved as a result of Garcia's unanimous decision, Adrien Broner, the former four-time World Champion, on Saturday, both fighters belong to the top five in the scale chart.
Garcia handed out her right hand and said, "How are you doing, Champion?
I wish you success."
Lomachenko will protect his belt with Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 19:00 on ESPN.
When the couple posed for the photos, Lomachenko's manager, Egis Klimas, noted that the possible confrontation between the fighters would be "perfect measurement."
"I'm a former feather-weight," Garcia recalled.
"I moved up to [63,5 kg] for the Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm 66.5 kg small.
I want to move below the light weight.
And he has to move upwards with a light weight [1.2 kg] and then we can fight.
Fans have wanted it.
Let us offer them this."
Lomachenko agreed.
"The world needs this fight."
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be paid to look at it. This is part of his strategy, according to which he wants to let Lomachenko debut in the class 61,2 kg towards the end of this year, to make a possible meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 nocquauts) for the next summer, who also has an interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares and Campbell's match after the Lightweight Forum on 23 September.
"The viewing of this fight could be paid because the fans have wanted this confrontation," Garcia said, saying later that he is open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
"We are the main players.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said she had to be a "powerful fighter" and could go see her Saturday fight.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in praising Garcia, saying that in her opinion, the champion of the three divisions from Riverside looked "very slow; I'm sorry, Mikey... you wanted that knockout."
According to Garcia, the goal was to show the impact strength and then fight.
Both confirmed that they feel the tension to grow to prosperous.
"This is a struggle that awaits realization.
No other confrontation creates so much attention and buzz.
I'm more than willing to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been on the hold of the best fighters, and Mikey is just that.
It will be a good fight."
Which corners of the world are moving to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) extended and issued a record number of more than 13,000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work, study or to family.
If, for example, last year it was decided to issue a temporary residence permit to 6702 foreigners, then the tuna bubble was 4928.
The authorities cannot tell how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia, but such analysis will be prepared in the Ministry of the Interior.
While nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia ten years ago a year, in recent years this number will start to reach close to 2000.
The number of applicants for residence permits increased exponentially during the crisis in Ukraine - in 2014, 1087 people received a temporary residence permit, 675 a year earlier.
According to Statistics Estonia, the number of Ukrainian citizens is increasing the most in Estonia - 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia more than left last year.
"The Ukrainian community has been great in Estonia all the time, and due to difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are being sought from a country where the community and many have already had a family," said Kristin Rammus, spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior.
Last year and tuna bubbles were higher in the number of Ukrainians who received a temporary residence permit even above the number of Russian citizens, although the most fixed-term residence permits have been issued in the last few years.
If Ukrainians come here mostly to work, then Russian citizens for pererände.
"Considering the historical Russian community here, they are more likely to have the greatest family ties with the people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, Migration Researcher at the Estonian Academy of Security Sciences.
"If you look at where the Russian citizens who have received Estonia's residence permit have moved to live, then after Harju County, Ida-Viru County is immediately," he added and pointed out that about 40 per cent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Last year, 1696 Russian citizens were granted a temporary residence permit, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wanted to extend the residence permit decreased instead.
"The fact that instead of the extension of the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for to be permanently located in Estonia," explained Rammus, the spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained more stable for years.
Foreigners who have lived here for at least three years can apply for a new residence permit for a permanent basis to take Estonia permanently from the previous year.
Its aim is to encourage the survival of the accustomed people.
However, the long-term resident's residence permit requires, for example, five years.
The extension of the old residence permit has probably decreased after the new residence permit.
For example, last year, such a residence permit was issued to 146 Ukrainians who have been working here for at least three years.
Now the Ukrainians can change jobs and the Estonian state no longer finger the sequel to whether the salary criterion is met.
This residence permit became popular - last year more grey passport holders (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
In total, 1968 people, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese people, received a residence permit for the purpose of setting up in Estonia.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In ten years, Nigeria has become a country whose citizens are one of the most active applicants for a residence permit in Estonia.
While in 2007 three residence permits were issued to Nigerians, 200 were issued last year.
They come from Nigeria to study at universities here.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turks, for example.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen mainly due to educational migration.
In the case of them, too, there is a rule that where the community has arisen, there will be more others," Rammus added.
For ten years, two people have moved to Estonia, for example, from North Korea, as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If about 6,000 third-country nationals receive a residence permit per year, it is about 0.46 per cent of the total population.
Even if we think more about the citizens of the European Union, migration remains about a percentage," Maasing commented that the figures are actually small.
According to Statistics Estonia, 14,822 people travelled to Estonia last year, but 13 792 were out of here.
This means that immigration exceeded the second year of emigration.
Most of the exowers and inflorescences are Estonian citizens, but more of them are among the leavers.
Therefore, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was in deficit with 2000 people last year.
Estonians travel primarily between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture Princess Amoo charms with sats, embroidery and tulle
However, Maria Tammeoru has a history for Maria Tammeoru - old paintings and costumes: "I've been dreaming of old-fashioned sleeves and hiring old-fashioned sleeves and collars.
If you do something with passion, you study and learn more about it every day.
It's the joy of discovery!
The glamorous world of Mammu Couture may seem to some strangers, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide how much glow in your life!
I have a girlfriend with a whole sauna full of my stew couture dresses.
Because it's not his fault that he doesn't live in Hollywood and doesn't go to a red carpet every day, he wants to wear the most beautiful dresses and he's wearing!
You can live your own life special!
The fashion designer does not recognise the gap between bright events and the gray everyday life.
It was this reasoning that put the high fashion in Estonia to the countryside, between forests and fields, to people who often do not reach fashion.
The Mammu collection was presented in Võru, Jõhvi and Pärnu fashion fair, where the royal defilet filled the whole street with 45 models.
In Tallinn, the posture is often taken, noded with dignity, but there are more emotions elsewhere - braavo, stand up, want to thank you by hand.
A lot of the audience just came to look at, but now they're Mammu Couture fans.
If you exceed people's expectations, they're fascinated!
And I like the feeling that I'm on a summer tour with my fashion my fashion.
In Pärnu, we had a 50-metre-long red carpet, full of beautiful dresses all over the street, it seemed that they would not have an end!
Maria also does not admit that the creations must be presented to a supermodel, she happily brings ordinary women to the stage.
I often call on my own clients on stage - they have always come with joy.
It's such a great experience, you can shine on stage in a beautiful dress!
I'm so sorry I've never seen my show myself, I've always been backstage to give things as a hopeless perfectionist the last touch.
My nerve wouldn't let you watch the hall calmly.
Maria is the kind of fashion designer who doesn't just want to play a role in the office, but in everything by hand.
I have my sewing machine in the studio, most of the collection I do myself.
I like the whole process of playing with details, you'll discover.
I'm never far from my creation, and I'm not afraid of work.
It is not about design, including stylistics, logistics, organization, organisation, organisation - everything must fit in the day of a temperamental woman.
These hours of work are still on fanatics.
I can't tell you when my workday ends, for me, it's just a day full of joy!
I am very lucky - it is like a chain of incessant happiness: I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and, in turn, compliments.
Several times it has been said that my dresses have magic - they make themselves feel like a princess.
The rich dull sacircuit series that made Maria's talent famous overnight have remained the signature of Mammu Couture until today.
Martin Müürsepp U18 Boys: Estonians' subgroup tournament's weapon is now turned against us
Sorry, the fairy tale ran out.
The first thing I noticed was that we couldn't get our table.
And if there is such a big difference, there is nothing to do," commented Martin Müürsepp, assistant coach of BC Kalev/Cramo, who played for the UK at 61:75, the Estonian basketball boys' 61:75.
The opponents took 28 balls from the attack table and received so many more attacks.
We weren't ready for their aggressive protection or attack, either.
Many of the English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we couldn't build defenses.
In the defense, however, they could keep their hands everywhere, we couldn't combine.
It knocked the crew down.
The homework of the opponents was better done.
According to the margentle, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to take down the impetus of their opponents in the bud.
In the last quarter - we had zero mistakes, but the opponents have already received several quick baskets.
Athleticism and a tight pick-up, which was our weapon in the subgroup tournament, turned everything against us now.
Today we had no strength against their aggression.
The mason was satisfied with his ward in Kalev, Matthias Tass.
In general, the tournament can say good words about the whole team, and a single punch fist was still there.
It's a pity that he's never met an aggressive adversary before.
The cup has always been confident and played out today, but it seemed that he was tired - he has worn quite a burden.
But he made some pretty moves I've ever seen in practice," added the tutor.
Horrible numbers: the basketball team of the maids scored less than 10 points in three quarters of the EM tournament...
The U18 age group is not just a basketball tournament for young men's B-division in Tallinn, the girls started in Dublin the day before yesterday.
And unfortunately, the Estonian game with Poland was the practice of anti-records.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter, the position was 9:49, i.e. only at the last ten minutes, the opponents took their foot off the accelerator and the period remained at 16:16.
In the first and second quarters, Estonia scored 4, the third one...
In the beginning, two of the first four shots were hit by the Estonians in two minutes, but 25 from the game, then one in three, and then by 21 shots...
Maybe for almost half an hour, 47 shots were captured.
In addition, there were 2 points out of four free throws.
There were a reasonable number of ball losses at that time, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland had a hit of 33 per cent and Estonia had 13 per cent (68/9).
Estonia has begun with two losses, and on the opening day, the superiority of Portugal was to be recognised at 83:56.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to replenish supplies
Today, NATO's 1st permanent mine defence group arrived in Tallinn for a scheduled port visit to Tallinn to replenish the stocks of ships and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships prepare to return to the sea and give the members of the crew the opportunity for a couple of days of rest.
After the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to carry out several exercises and be ready for future operations for the search for historical explosive devices.
"The participation of the Estonians in the NATO unit and the co-operation training carried out by them in local waters is well illustrated by our integration with the Allied forces," said Major Arto Reinmaa, the commander of the Operation and Planning Division, who is the commander of the naval fleet.
Since 29 June, the 1st permanent mine defence group of NATO will be led by Lieutenant Gvido Laudups, a Latvian marine lieutenant, who took over the duties of group leader from the Estonian naval officer in Tartu from the Estonian navy officer, Commander Johan-Elias Selja.
The flagship of the group is the Latvian Navy support vessel LVNS Virsaitis, which also operates the group's command headquarters.
This half-year is also part of the international unit Sakala, a mine hunter of the Estonian Navy.
One of the four groups of ships under NATO's maritime command, NATO's 1st permanent mine defence group is a ready-made unit belonging to primary rapid rapid respondents, who can be sent to different places in the world within five days.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of Pirita Monastery will once again become a place where the Birgitta Festival, which was launched by Maestro Eri Klasi, will be held 13 years ago.
This year's Birgitta Festival will be a beautiful, powerful and unprecedented artistic director of Tallinn Philharmonic, according to Risto Joosti (36).
Risto Joost: The classics of the opera world are "Traviata" and "Tosca," ballet performances from the captivating "Bolerost" to the fun "Karlsson," and the programme is also not lacking in its own production, which this time is Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratoratorial performance by the same international creative team, who brought the second master of Haydn to the stage in 2015.
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre productions.
It's bigger than any music theatre in its usual form.
It's a festival whose enchantment takes over and never let go of the real one again.
For the experience that the listener receives in this sublime and mysterious environment makes human souls ring and touches human perceptions in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you're the artistic director of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't the shoes of Maestro Eri Klas look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, it's been a lot of help.
He put me through my entire career and supported me at the beginning of my career as well.
Maybe it's because of that it's easier for me to keep working.
Eri Klas has injected so much goodness to the Birgitta Festival team and, of course, it is transferred to me.
It was great to join a team who knows exactly how it works.
It was the great heart of Eri Klas that gave me the strength to move forward with the Birgitta Festival in Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am, and I'll be fine!
What could excite the audience at this year's festival, what do you offer?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, by the way, the first ballet to be presented, written on Astrid Lindgren's story.
That's "Karlsson flies."
And one curiosity of the nuance is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed his wish to write this work.
He's probably been living in the hands of Karlsson since he was a kid.
Risto, how do you get all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and I have a lot of love, and luckily I have a heap.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions are not so dependent on other people as I am about myself, i.e. how I will meet every new day.
And this kind of conscious tone, toss tositivity, toss tositivity and actually smiling to yourself in the morning in the mirror, significantly increased my percentage of happiness.
Especially this week, when the most important samples are, I have practiced it especially eagerly and it works.
Smiling itself activates the brain and raises tone.
It's not just a jingle.
I don't think people know half the things about their body that the universe is offering them yet, but everyone gradually discovers it.
Now, it's a big moment.
Do you have any ritual before the conductor's remote?
It is, the clothes need to be changed for more comfortable.
This is this little moment for yourself.
But generally, yes, I have no chance to rest or take a little nap before the big performance.
In fact, I even like to communicate actively with people, even before going to the conductor's remote.
But come to the Birgitta Festival, here you can discover what to discover not much of an opera and ballet friend!
Watch a spirited video with Risto Joost!
New results of the Swedish asylum seekers" age assessment tests were published
In Sweden, a test was carried out among asylum seekers, during which their age was assessed medically with a novel approach, and the latest results of the test show that more than 80 per cent of the TeFI was judged to be older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish Institute of Forensics (Rätsmermaket) started testing towards the beginning of this year.
The tests were created in the course of applying for an Azyl for a more precise age after the Swedish Department of Migration (Migredersverket) was criticised for the fact that they had failed to correctly determine the age of many allegedly minor refugees.
By now, Migrationsverket has been testing for 6880 cases and the Forensic Medicine Institute has issued a total of 2481 tests between mid-March 2017 and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) was estimated to be 18 years of age or older, and in another 25 cases, the Foresight Institute estimated that the Foresage Medicine Institute "may be 18 years of age or older."
In the case of 432, it was concluded that man is "probably younger than 18."
Tests are used only if the age of a person is under question.
According to Johan Göransson, working at the Institute forensic Medicine, the results are consistent compared to those of the previous months.
"We do not see much difference compared to the statistics of previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he said to The Local.
The fact that a large part of the cases were assessed older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The Institute issued the results of the 581 test in May and said that in 442 cases, "there are indications that the person under investigation is 18 years of age or older."
But when Svenska Dagblade was examined by the results of these 581 tests, it turned out that in 243 people had claimed directly that he would receive 18 this year.
This method of medical age assessment, in the course of which X-ray images of wisdom teeth and the Knees are made of MRT, after which they are allowed to be analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticised in some districts.
One of the sceptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, whose duties include the assessment of the biological maturity of people in order to determine whether they passed puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I do not think that the method of measurement currently being used should be used.
The determination of biological age in this way is highly uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we should not pretend to be able," he told Metro.
But Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Institute defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of a child's imprecise adulting is low.
The highest, i.e. about 10%, is the risk if a person is a little less than 18."

20-year-old hammer thrower Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut at the London World Cup, taking a good 18th place with 67.37.
The organ was the youngest female hitthrower of MM, and the cheerful woman confirmed that she hoped to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and got a good experience.
With the first test (64.80), I immediately made my average result, the second (62.80) I risked too much, and on the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear," Orel said after the competition.
I was looking for my throws, and I'm really glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orel's debut ended in a fine 18th place.
The rain did not interfere with the Oreli, because he trains the winter through TUT stadium.
"I'm tempered," he said with a little smile.
The London Olympic Stadium had almost a full house of people, did the Orel sense the people around him or were able to shut down?
I sensed, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it's gonna add - that's it!
If you compete, you can experience it.
The organ confirmed that he would be satisfied with the debut of the MSM and there are many more good competitions waiting for him: "I came here with the 32nd or last result of this season, I ended up in 18th place.
This is a very good result.
I'm 20 years old and at the World Cup, that's all that matters.
I'm taking a good experience with me, and some days I want to compete for medals.
Governor of West Virgina announces party exchange
West Virginia Democrat Governor Jim Justice announced at the meeting with President Trump on Thursday night that he was changing the party.
"Made's it or not, the Democrats walked away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you, having prayed and thoughtfully... today I tell you, the West Servants, that I cannot help you as a democratic governor anymore."
On the gathering, the cheers were released.
"So I'll be a Republican tomorrow," added Justice.
"Ath a trainer, I'd tell you it's time to play another game."
Trump had promised a great announcement before at the West Virginia meeting.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia and Justice did not support the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Under Forbes, who is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and the coal business inherited his father.
It's worth about 1.59 billion dollars.
At the same time, the National Committee of the Republicans (RNC) published a announcement on Thursday evening that "the exchange of Governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would rather prevent the country from being better again than working for it."
"The 15 governorship seats and control of the lowest number of states in history - the announcement of the Governor is simply the most recent rejection of a party that is run from the end and cannot find a positive and unifying message," said the head of RNC, Ronna McDaniel, in a statement to CBS News.

Watch the video to see if the festive people ask for analgesic for the treatment of hangovers.
Coe praised the Russians honest apologies for the doping scandal
According to him, Sebastian Coe, the international leader of athletics, praised the "right apology from Russia on Thursday" for the doping scandal, but reiterated that this is not the time to allow the country back to sports.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, the leader of Russian athletics, said at the IAAF Congress held on the eve of the Athletics World Cup that the competition ban imposed on his country was correct and has a definite goal of fighting doping.
He apologized to "all athletes who have been snatched by gold medals and silver medals in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of the competition ban imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think it was a very honest response today, a very honest presentation," said Coe, President of IAAF, to journalists.
"The Health Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Sub-Union himself acknowledged that they had quite difficult times and they were doing everything possible to restructure the sub-Union."
According to Coe, he was also pleased that Russia accepted its reinstatement criteria.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is taking place, but Congress supports the proposal of the working group that now is not the right time to take back Russia," Coe said.
"We have to do everything possible in the next few months to normalize the situation.
We have always proceeded from the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from the corrupted system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict criteria of IAAF will compete as neutral athletes at the World Athletics Championships in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, Head of the IAAF Working Group, said on Monday that Russia did not meet several reinstatement criteria yet.
Following a presentation to the Council of IAAF, he said to journalists in London that doping control is still inadequate and the coaches who have been banned are still working freely.
The revolution of electric cars significantly changes the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only does the revolution of electric cars make a significant difference from the fuel market to infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
Although mine giants like Glencore can say that they win from one place and lose the other, smaller mining companies don't help.
Glencore currently serves coal and oil, but in the future electric car era, the demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminum and nickel is growing.
This year, the decisions of the governments of the United Kingdom, France and Norway, which will allow the sale of new cars using fossil fuels, have contributed to the proliferation of electric cars this year.
Volvo has already known that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine and Tesla launches a cheaper model 3 electric car.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts have been selling more electric cars over the course of two decades than those using oil-generated fuels.
"For some metals, it changes everything," said Capital Economics's raw material analyst Simona Gambranini Bloomberg.
We have already seen a great impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, the demand for which has grown for years.
There are about three times as many copper in electric cars than in a regular car, Glencore reported.
Even more copper is needed at charging stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribasi estimates that this will increase the demand for copper by about five per cent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries means additional requirements for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese demand.
Glencore will be profitable from the growing trend of electric cars from copper price increases and that he is the world's largest cobalt manufacturer, projected by Jefferies Group.
According to this brokerage company, the winners of other electric cars are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
This year, the Cobalt has increased by 70 per cent on the London Metal Exchange.
Last year's price increase was 37 per cent.
Copper has also increased by 14 per cent this year, mainly because of economic growth.
Glencore's share rose by 20 per cent in London, having crossed the price rivals from the price increase to Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American.
On the losing side, lead companies like Recyclex and Campine are on the losing side, who need to adapt to the new era.
Lead end-use is the flow of starters for petrol and diesel cars.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to demand for lead unless it is found for another purpose that could overcome the fall in demand," said Michael Widmer, Head of Analysis for Metal Market at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The impact of the lead price movement is not yet visible.
The price of lead has increased by 17 per cent this year, with the best metal in London as the best metal in prices.
Investors see problems for metal only in the long future.
"I'm not sure it's so bad for lead, because cheap oil keeps regular cars competitive," said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager of Triland Metals, a metal broker.
When the demand for lead falls, it occurs slowly.
Maybe it's gonna happen in about ten years.
Until then, stricter exhaust emission standards mean increasing the demand for hybrid cars, which depends on advanced lead-based batteries when starting frequent engines, is assessed by an international research organisation of lead and zinc.
Light metals such as aluminum replace steel, as a lighter car can drive away with less electricity.
This explains the additional 1.6 million-ton aluminium demand for an additional amount of 1.6 million tonnes already until 2013.
It accounts for 2.7 per cent of the world's total production of aluminium.
This trend is likely to get worse, said Widmer.
Aluminum has increased by 13 per cent this year, as the growing demand by car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
Steel manufacturers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding works with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce tiny car hulls.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop a lighter alloy of steel to resist the aluminium minimum.
"Super-strong steel should be the answer to this development," said Sylvain Brunet, analyst of Exane BNP Paribas.
There is some success in Europe.
The end of the oil age can also bring suffering to platinum.
Last year, about half of this precious metal was spent as catalysts for diesel cars, reported by the metal refiner Johnson Matthey.
"At many of the present times, raw materials with high demand, such as oil and platinum, may not have high demand in the future," said Bernard Dahdah, the raw material analyst of Natixis.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important, but their importance will change over 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe in the continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Marc Grynberg, head of Uncore, said that in 2025, more hybrid cars are still being sold than all-electric cars.
The great hope of the Platinum producers in the 10 years run has been developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos on hydrogen-based cars, which depend on platinum to produce electricity from hydrogen.
However, so far, this technology has not yet established itself commercially.
"The sheel seems to have a clear loser on its way to electric cars," said Exane BNP Paribasist Brunet.
German car manufacturers were awarded a major repercussion in July, as the Stuttgart court banned the use of diesel in the hometown of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How football finance rules affect Neymar's transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unbridled spending by European football clubs do not prevent Neymar's world record transition from the Spanish football club to Barcelona France's club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences of UEFA, the governing body governed by the European Union and are powered by prohibiting teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament, Paris is still waiting for Saint-Germain to be held.
The financial rules for fair play (FFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must at some point prove that Neymar's transfer was financed without enormous losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million (B22 million) for buying out of his contract alone, and Neymar's salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar's French club.
PSG will undoubtedly be able to pay Neymar and add such money to a line-up, given that the team is financed by the family of Qatar's energy rich in energy wealth.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot on recruiting players, but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that will enable them to come out in the football business.
FFP was founded by Michel Platin after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that the clubs, who would fall into great debt in the search for success, are actually cheating and risk ruining if banks or owners had to give up the support.
Since 2011, FFP has been focusing on monitoring losses instead of debts of FFP clubs.
This change means that the business model Roman Abramovich used first in 2003 in Chelsea - to buy a club with potential and then to make a high cost to improve the team and create a global brand - is more difficult to implement.
During the current three-year assessment period of FFP, which will run until 2018, the clubs may bear losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite Platin being displaced with shamelessness in 2015 from the office of President, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, is still committed to obstructing excessive spending.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules in the future," said Andrea Traverso, the UEFA, the supervisor of FFP in UEFA.
Although PSG paid Neymar's transfer penalty for a single total payment, they are able to distribute this amount for accounting purposes into lots throughout the period of validity of the contract.
Neymar concluded a five-year contract, so it is possible to show the transfer fee in the next five years as an amount of EUR 44,4 million per year.
On the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the PSG, together with Manchester City owned Abu Dhabi, received the most severe sentences.
PSG was imposed a fine of EUR 60 million (at the moment of USD 82 million), which was later reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was required to limit the Champions League team to 21 players instead of the usual 25 in the 2014-2015 season.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to outwit regulators by blowing up its income through companies affiliated with the owners of the club.
The Qatar company may sponsor the PSG, but if the value of the sponsorship is considered to be exceeded by standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as an official income.
This happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority PSG's support was bloated.
It has been said that a certain part of Neymar's PSG service may come from Qatar through the 2022 World Cup Management Committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become an ambassador of the World Cup, and claim that UEFA regulators could easily expose such manoeuvre.
The penalties previously imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in connection with any attempt to ignore the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not proactively discussed the transition to Neymar with PSG.
They spoke with The Associated Press on the condition that their anonymity is ensured because they are not allowed to discuss the situation of the PSG.
The latest published reports show that PSG earned more than EUR 10 million in the 2015-2016 season with a turnover of approximately EUR 542.4 million.
Data from the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymar's arrival will have a good impact on sponsorship transactions, trade and shirt sales.
The club expects a turnover of at least 30% increase in turnover due to the conclusion of the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly upsetting the departure of one of the biggest football stars, attempted to prevent Neymar's transfer by claiming that PSG was thereby violating FFP.
"This is a clear "mode doping" case with the club and the state," said La Liga President Javier Tebas to the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that PSG belongs mainly to Qatar.
Arsenal's manager Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares the attitude of La Liga that the state is funding the club.
"This is the result of property rights and it has completely changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the state, anything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play, as the state may have other ways or other interests to represent such a large player in the country."

Along with the expansion of Norwegian geography, the circle of people who have earned a place on the cloud of aircraft has expanded.
The selected people include Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo (pictured) and Miguel de Cervantes.
In the near future, one plane will be decorated with a portrait of Freddie Mercury, the legendary singer of Queen.
Today 50 years ago: a hurricane-sized storm in Estonia that ripped roofs and windows from the houses.
A hurricane named a storm in the century, which raged on 6 and 7 August caused major damage to Läänemaa, Harju County and Raplamaa.
In Northwest Estonia, the wind speed was over 30 m/s during these days.
My old man ran from one curved tree in the garden to another and touched them with his hands to support them.
It was all dark and rough, like the end of the world.
The roofs of the houses already flew from the house, in 2002, the old lady Linda Kurova from Haapsalu, recalled in an interview given to the magazine Eesti Loodus.
Linda's husband saw the garden collapsed by her own plant.
But what are you still supporting trees with your hands, where do you get against this storm?
The sea came under the window, the water sprayed in from the windows," said Mrs. Linda, who lived on Kalda Street in Haapsalu at the time.
Linda saw only the next morning as most of the gravels, like the highlanders, that the roads were full of trees and the roof of the railway station.
According to the locals, behind Paralepa the trees were on the ground, some were completely down, some in half.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm went through beautiful old trees with a rag and a crack like a war.
Lääne-Viru County was not particularly severely affected in the August 1967 storm compared to Western Estonia, but the damage was also large, the Virumaa Teataja wrote in 2007.
Haapsalu Castle Park and Padise Park were wiped off the ground, but the parks in our area were also heavily damaged.
In Tallinn, the wind speed was measured up to 35 meters per second, i.e. about 130 kilometres per hour.
On the 6th of August evening in Tallinn, a little girl had shouted: "Mother, Mom!
The chickens are in the air and can no longer be signed," wrote Virumaa Teataja.
The Põlli manor building in Viljandimaa was destroyed during the storm so much that it was decided to demolish it later.
The constructions of Türi ski jump hill were not held for Augustitorm, which were no longer restored.
The Red Star newspaper wrote on 12 August 1967 that the cleaning of cities and settlements from fallen trees and their branches was progressing slowly, and that the inhabitants could participate in cleaning.
The grain fields were also severely damaged in the storm, and the newspaper announced that "the former organisations must be intel and as an incinerator in reconditioning as an incarnation and as a guider to harvesting."
Hurricane can be discussed if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record of the outbreak in Estonia will remain from 2 November 1969, when Ruhnu was measured at 48 m/s.
The instrument broke on the island of Vaindloo, so the strong wind speed measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The secret of clean bathing beaches: night cleaning and poor beach weather
The colder summer weather also mean a smaller cleaning area on the beaches of Tallinn.
"If there's weather, there are people on the beach, and if there are no people," says the beach cleaner.
The seagulls are screaming at the Stroomi beach in Northern Tallinn.
They are offered meloding competition at low rpm, which plows the stripes off the patch.
In fact, the latter sifts through the sand at a depth of seven centimetres, picking out sea rabbles and a crossover from people: bottle caps, cigarette bones and more.
People still come to the beach, regardless of whether the water is warm or not.
If it's a beautiful weather, there are people on the beach, and if there are no people," says Aleksandr Usov, Head of the Beach Cleanup Department of Haabersti.
It's 6:30 and there's a bitter clean-up on the beach, because at 8 o'clock, the site has to be in order for people.
Sazee's on the job at 4:00.
Besides Stroomi, he keeps an eye on the shores of Pirita, Harku Lake, Kakumäe and Paljasaare Pikakari.
The amount of waste has decreased.
Years ago, it was much more.
People can now appreciate what is being done for them," says Usov, who has been cleaning the beaches for 15 years.
It was before that when something new got up, it was broken the next day.
Now they're keeping what's on the beach.
Price of the clean beach
One of the biggest works on the beaches of Estonia is cleaning sea litter washed on the shore, i.e. adru.
For example, on Pirita Beach, it has to be transported to the beach season to 400,000 tons.
"This is an incredible amount," believes Usov.
The second large category is household waste, i.e. all that people leave behind.
The half-kilometre Stroomi beach strip has eight large garbage containers that need to be emptied three times a week.
There's so much rubbish.
However, the colder summer weather has meant that the garbage is a fifth less than otherwise.
The third species is abandoned things.
Mostly, they're kids.
As a harvest this time, Usov has shoveled out of the sand a dozen model cars.
They will wait for the owners to the wooden road leading to the beach.
"Typically, they're gonna come out more, but that's a normal prey." Usov already knows that soon he'll find them in the sand again.
The children come to the beach and take the toys to drown them again in the sand.
Garbage is scattered
Erika Scholler, the representative of Haabersti's administrative services, admits that the tractor's screening work is disturbed by locals.
The noise that lasts from night hours to early morning interferes with the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
However, this work is impossible during the day.
In one month, the beach has to be screened twice.
"If we don't, the district will fine us," Scholler notes.
But similarly to Pirita, Pikakar and Pärnu, the goal is to get Stroomi Beach under the quality mark of the international bluetail.
"Compared to Europe, there is much more work in Estonia to keep the beaches maintained," says Scholler.
We have more adru and more stones and harder to sift sand.
However, there are fewer garbage on our beaches than in other parts of Europe.
Having heard about rubbish on the beach, Martin, who lives near Stroomi Beach, is unforcedly stepping into a discussion circle between journalists and cleaning workers, highlighting the current bottlenecks on the beach.
There's a nasty picture everywhere in the mornings.
The problem with the birds and the bottle pickers who have pulled the trash bags upside down," says Martin.
Although it is difficult to assume that people are able to change their behavioural habits, Martin hopes that the city government will do something with trash cans and will, for example, put them on cover, for example, to prevent birds from looking at them.
In general, however, Martin is satisfied with the development of the Stroomi beach.
I can see the city takes care of it.
With children's fields, illuminated and freshly asphalted roads, it has become more pleasant.
It was once so that only one road could only drive on roller skates," says Martin.
Founders of Stem in Stroomi: coins, coins only
The 40-year-old Dimitri, who combs the edge of the metal detector, has been used in the morning tidal period.
He doesn't think today or in the future will find anything valuable.
The gods of the sea are not generous enough.
"I've been dealing with this for a year and I haven't found anything of value so far," says Dmitri.
As a Hobish hunter, the Dartpack has some euro coins, bottle caps and also dangerous nails that later throws into the trash can.
Usually there are coins.
"There's no cult, rings and all that," says the treasure hunter.
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0.25%
Bank of England is expected to report that interest rates remain at its former level, as unsuccessful economic growth and inflation mitigation have softened speculation due to the increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish, as the wages' sturdy incomes have put interest rates on hold.
The policymakers of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to hold the 6:2 rates at 0.25%, and fewer members demand an increase this month, as slow growth has weakened the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut the 2017 growth forecast to 1.7% and to 1.6% in 2018 and warned that pressure on household incomes would remain, as inflation is still expected to rise by 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the bank also indicated that the increase in rates will be necessary to control the inflation caused by Brexit in the next few years and that a higher increase in credit costs may be required on the financial markets than expected.
The members also voted a year ago in favour of the partial withdrawal of the revitalising mammoth package launched as a result of Brexit.
In February, the bank will close a fixed-term financing scheme that provides low-cost financing for the banks, although he said that now GBP 15 billion is expected under this scheme, which is GBP 115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision on the rate, the bank says: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) will remain powerless in the near future, as the difficult situation of the actual incomes of households will continue to have an impact on consumption."
For the rates, it was reiterated that "a little tightening of the monetary policy" was necessary to alleviate inflation, to the extent that "sometimes higher" than the markets are expected.
The stock exchange is now predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and the second increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any jump is gradual and limited.
The bank's reduced growth forecasts for this and the following year are comparable to May's forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast of growth of 1.8 per cent in 2018 remained.
After this news, the price of the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to USD 1.31 and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth indicators that have suppressed the increasing hopes of increasing GDP - GDP rose from 0.2% in the second quarter of the previous three months to 0.3%.
The bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it will start to gain a little momentum.
The latest inflation report by the bank gave little reason to cheer up households suffering from rising inflation and miserable wage rises, saying that the situation will get a little worse before recovery.
It was added that monetary policy could not prevent the impact of incomeing in the next few years, but wages are expected to be significantly restored towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Due to the weak pound, the economy is also encouraged by the growing demand for British production, which partly compensates for lower costs for consumers.
The decision will come one year after the rates were taken to 0,25% last August after the shocking EU referendum, which caused a sudden weakening of the pound.
In the Bank's opinion, it is likely that it will take four years to fully breathe life on prices and the economy.
Before the last decision of the bank, there was an increasing demand for an increase in the rate of improvement, as inflation had increased the pressure on households in distress; in July, three policy makers demanded an increase of 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although according to the bank it was expected and in the coming months there is a rise again.
The Bank said that the excessive increase compared to the 2% target was entirely due to a weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Head of Coreco's Mortgage Maurittizers, said: "According to the recent decline in exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market is becoming more and more competitive, as lenders are starting to work and hoping to end the year positively.
The stock exchange seems particularly favourable to those who are running the transactions to be completed, as refinancing, often without a service charge and at a low rate, has become more and more popular."
NHS is writing HIV medicine that caused a contradiction to 10,000 people
Patients have access to "transformative" anti-HIV treatment since September after the battle held in the Supreme Court on whether NHS should finance the medicinal product.
NHS England announced that national health is now making available to 10 000 people an estimated 10 000 people in an initial three-year clinical trial (PrEP) tablet, which is administered before intercourse and has shown a reduction in the risk of infection by approximately 86% for high risk people.
NHS agreed to finance the clinical test after the Court of Appeal supported the Supreme Court's decision of last year, according to which NHS is able to pay for PrEP, despite the authority's own arguments that the medicinal product should be financed by local authorities instead.
Simon Stevens, the CEO of NHS England, welcomed this course published on Thursday as "new extensive intervention," while the National AIDS Fund (NAT) described it as a "modern moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register people, and more clinics will be added in October before the programme is implemented everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV medicines that is taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Clinical trial results show that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV among people with the risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there are enough medicines in the human body to prevent HIV from being infected.
Such medicinal products may be taken each day or at the latest two hours before intercourse.
Candidates suitable for treatment include homosexual or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and are not treated.
The clinics identify suitable people who are willing to participate in a clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV partner does not receive antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also check in the local sexual health clinic participating in the programme.
The programme costs GBP 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to receive medicines this week after the international tender procedure.
The purpose of the clinical test is to assess the actual potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence of who is intended for and how it is consumed and applied in the large picture.
Stevens said: "This new extensive intervention should complement and amplify a wide-ranging and ever more successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is another milestone in the fight of more than three decades on one of the biggest health problems of mankind."
Deborah Gold, CEO of the NAT, said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted correctly for those who need it and belong to the risk group, offers the opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people with high risk HIV in England have access to a powerful new tool that is individually manageable and not dependent on negotiations with a partner, thereby improving many lives, through a clinical trial funded by the NHS.
We welcome this announcement warmly."
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "Now it is essential to ensure that a clinical test is forced to quickly launch the country and that no member of the HIV risk group would be excluded.
Now that the medicine has been procured by a clinical trial of PrEP, we are on our way to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of being infected with HIV.
Sharon Hodgson, the shadow minister of public health, said: "The beginning of the clinical trial of PrEP is very welcome and hard after months of delays and dragging the legs of the government.
Evidence shows how major changes this drug can bring HIV to the prevention work and the end of the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical test will take us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical test be taken across the country as soon as possible to protect people exposed to HIV and to bring us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
The price of electricity increased by 12% in Estonia, while in Latvia and Lithuania decreased.
In July, the difference between the price of the next day's stock exchange price decreased to 1.94 euros between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania, compared to 7.71 euros in June this year, Elering said.
The main reason for the price difference is the failures of the Lithuanian-Sweden connection.
The average stock exchange price in Estonia last month was 34.33 euros from megawatt-hour, and the price increased by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent to 36.27 euros per megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was 34.17 euros and the system price of Nord Pool on the power exchange was 26.37 euros per megawatt-hour.
Prices increased by 12 and seven per cent, respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, 75 per cent of the previous months moved from the hours of the previous month to Estonia and 16 per cent of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine per cent of the hours between the two countries did not have any subsequent day transactions.
Electricity between Estonia and Latvia moved from 99 per cent of the time to Latvia and 73 per cent of the hours had the total transmission capacity in use.
According to transactions on the last trading day of July, the price of electricity on the Nasdaq OMX market may be approximately 34 euros and in September 37 euros per megawatt-hour.
The price of carbon dioxide, which has an impact on the production price of electricity, increased last month and the transactions took place at a price of 5,04-5.7 euros per tonne.
Living high - half-floor and smart design tips have made this little Earls Court apartment a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate innovator, exchanged his big Knightsbridge home for Earls Court's apartment in 2014.
It is located on the ground floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne has not packed up her bags and sold the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
"Before I lived with a former partner in Knightsbridge on a much larger surface," Joanne said.
"I was looking for something that would be equivalent at the price I offer.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day."
Since the first visit, this 93-square-metre apartment has undergone a full renovation.
At first, it was an apartment with one bedroom and a complex layout - to get to the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half floor to use the high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
These were my demands," he said.
He hired a boundary ceilings of 3.8 m high and to create a home that would not just be a development object, but a place for Joanne to live in, and to live with a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two rooms to each other, so there was an architectural challenge to create a half-floor where you could stand up.
Erfan had to approach the thing creatively.
"Metall construction is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to reorganise the rooms so that they are located on top of each other without bend over.
It was not just the construction of the platform, but used the steel structure to ensure that the height of both the upper and lower spaces would be correct."
This position allowed Erfan to create two full-height rooms in the room with plenty of dramatic elements.
The half-storey view of the glamorous living space below the Retrouvius window with old-fashioned copper light opens.
Golden furniture, silver details and retro-scented Serge Mouille luminaire with mirrored surface emphasize the style of the room.
Using mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, space and light-tuition.
Mirrors have been added to both ends of the short corridor to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the back wall with a mirror gives the impression of a window opening in another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet offers a storage space for all Joanne cutleries and glassware.
The charm of the living room is complemented by the possibility of closing the kitchen part when it is not used, creating an image of a more glamorous room.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
However, there is a unique fact that it is a garage-type retractable door.
"This was a bit of a design whale," explains Erfan steel-enhanced veneered MDF door.
"It has a counterweight, so it slides very easily when pushing it up."
Thanks to the smart use of the room and storage room, Joanne now has 16 extra square meters, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"After all, the floor area is what you are selling - or what gives value to real estate," says Erfan.
"The property broker enters the room in an outdated form and makes calculations based on the area of the floor."
Here they have managed to increase the floor space, using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
"The material are what you touch and thus help to create an emotional connection with your home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in the electrical cable on the wall.
It is important, but it does not make the heart ring."
It shows that a good design and an enlarged area will help to make something amazing from a fairly ordinary apartment.
In fact, they could make a desire not to leave, as happened to Joanne.
The protagonist Dane Jensen is a Chicago sky-breaking bounty hunter who competes with a colleague for a promotion.
It doesn't matter more than a earned amount of money, next to which any ethics forget.
A man sees his wife and three children only early in the morning and late at night.
In the first half of the film, I feel like it's the "Cardhouse" version of the business world - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's speech mane is similar.
The more the film goes on, the less the frame-home element, and the moralizing intention of the filmmakers is becoming more and more visible.
A life-changing experience will be the disease of the son of the protagonist.
Now you have to make a choice between work and family life.
A son, dreaming of an architect, makes his father's walks in Chicago's great buildings think about really important things like faith, goodness, love..., not even a catastrophe of twin towers.
After the third scene, where the son opens his father's eyes, there is a feeling that the filmmakers have proceeded from the goal of being able to cry, because even the spectator with the most expensive heart cannot hold back the tears when seeing the suffering of a cute boy with cancer.
When the son falls into a coma and his situation almost seems hopeless, his father will finally understand the morality of his work and do a good deed job for an old man seeking work.
Now I'm betting myself - if the film has a happy one, I'm rewarding my perceptiveness after a movie with coffee, but if I'm wrong, the writer can be praised for at least one surprise.
For a moment there's a suspicion that I'm gonna lose my coffee - when my husband calls Dane from the hospital and the man rushes down the hallway to the ward.
The son, however, has been wonderfully healed, and although his father has just lost his job, it turns out to be positive, because now there is time to deal with the family.
I can also feel good - I can predict the end of the American drama quite well!
In the honor of truth, the film is well constructed, all the necessary elements are there.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and morals beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
This movie must be good.
Trump's new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the media consumption of the President.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
Then he'd be the first.
Politico writes that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information that comes to President Trump, including the news, in the hope that it will keep the boss in a flat water.
Here's a break from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When the new Chief of Staff of the White House, John F. Kelly, met with high-ranking officials on his first working day, he pointed out the key problem in the White House of President Donald Trump, which he intended to solve - the receipt of bad information into the hands of the President.
Kelly told the officials that the information had to move through her, either on paper or at meetings, because the President would make better decisions than to share good information."
Kelly's diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have also tried it, and they have failed to tame Trump with monitoring her media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades, and even now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habits have not disappeared.
"When the candidate Trump was upset about the unfair media coverage, he paid to show him that he was also honestly reflected in the influenced publications," said former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg to Politico in February.
Politico Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the six former campaign workers say that Trump's Twitter habits are the key to managing Trump's Twitter habits, to ensure that his personal media consumption also includes a stable praise song."
All right. All right.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habits have ever been "controlled" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something that the rest of us do not know - that Trump's tweets would have been even more ignited without these interventions.
We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't post.
If his assistants were able to save him from trouble, even a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to prevent Trump from consistently controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, consisting of competing clicks, people are trying to promote their own interests without exception, by transmitting material to Trump that supports their worldviews, but may not always be reliable.
Politico, which reflects the course of the story, wrote in May about the tendency of the advisors to feed the President information of strategicly questionable value.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is:
"Current and former Trump subordinates say that Trump can react to the negative press, especially with adverse effects of information leaks, explosively, obsessed with the identification of their source.
This also happened at the end of February, when someone disgracedly gave the President a printed copy of the Internet Provocator, Charles C. Johnson, an article on GotNews.com, which accused the Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh, that she was the White House's "source of multiple information leaks."
It doesn't matter that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter due to mockery, or that he did not offer any specific evidence, or that he has also filed false charges in the past and withdrawn them.
Trump read the article and began to ask the subordinates about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that at that time's Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Head of the White House Office Rob Porter "has attempted to establish a system for managing and documenting documents that will power to Trumpin."
How did that work?
Kelly tries to do exactly the same three months later.
He may be a more effective leader than Pribus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These unchanged factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad don't get anxious to procure a permit to perform.
Many foreigners go to the centre of Tallinn to make music.
Those with whom the Evening Page got to be heard, admitted that they were playing in the Old Town without the permission of the government.
We first found three street musicians near Viru Gates, who had taken the same number of dogs with him.
It was clear that the musicians with cutting pads and broken clothes were backpackers who could use a shower.
Despite the appearance, the only woman of the group played a story with a fun rhythm on the accordion, while one man staring with three balls and called the passers-bys closer to him.
The third man had sat on one backpack next to them and smoked a roll of his own winded joint in peace of mind.
Their three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the passing crowd.
Bob, who played the accordion with Noem and the balls, said that you were making music on the streets for both fun and money.
The purpose of the performance of the company was to collect the ticket money on the evening of the same day for a ship travelling to Finland.
On the question of whether they asked the city for permission to make music in the Old Town, they shook Noem and Bob's head.
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we will never survive more than a day or two in one city, and most of the time the permits will be given for a month or something like that.
There is no point in paying for that," explained Bob.
When we got back to the Viru Gates about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were with musicians and drove them away.
The company moved with backpacks and dogs to touch happiness at the intersection of Viru Keskus.
Three Polish young men also performed on Viru Street, one of whom played a violin, the other clarinet, and the third had even been accompanied by an electronic piano.
"We are here to entertain people in order to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living," explained the trio pianist Mivosh.
According to Mivosh, they are aware that there must be permission from the city government to perform.
"Naturally, we don't have it," he said, jokingly.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there's no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we're going somewhere else, but we have to try," he added.
Eesti Pank purchased 149 million euros of bonds in July under the public sector asset purchase programme of the central bank, and the bond portfolio of the central bank increased to EUR 4.36 billion.
The central bank does not publish more detailed information about purchases.
Hardo Hansson, the President of the Estonian Bank, has previously explained, in response to the interpellation between the members of the Riigikogu, that the Eurosystem central banks" asset purchase programme includes three different purchase programmes: covered bonds (covered bonds of the financial sector), asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank buys bonds from the market in order to encourage investors who have sold bonds to invest money elsewhere.
Under the influence of purchases, the return on assets with a lower risk decreases and this motivates investors to take higher risks.
As a general rule, within the framework of a public sector bond purchase programme, each central bank buys its own government bonds, no other country bonds are purchased.
As the Estonian state has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank makes so-called substitute purchases within the volume allocated to them.
The replacement purchases are also made by central banks in those countries where the provision of bonds corresponding to the purchase programme is limited.
According to Hansson, Eesti Pank usually buys bonds from European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Investment Bank bonds.
Eesti Pank will buy bonds under the asset purchase programme as of March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering's bonds were acquired, but Eesti Pank will no longer buy Elering bonds from June 2016.
On behalf of the central banks of the euro area, both Elering and Eesti Energia will buy bonds from June.
Travelers ignore the ditch and return to the "Millionaire District"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands have again been in fierce confrontation with determined travelers who have ignored the council dug into a ditch to win back the field away from their villas.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans on the field as a wealthy "millionaire district" near Solihulli Street.
They have returned with an army of horses, children and trucks after they were knocked out in May without letting themselves be interrupted by a ditch dug in their invasion by the council to prevent them.
The tactical group found a weak spot in the guards, squeezing its vehicles through the unhindered part that was left to be a footpath.
The inhabitants of the marvelous are squealed by the Soihull Council, saying that the council is "nerorable in dealing with the problem."
One anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after they were excluded from Bentley Heath, where they threw pastors with stones.
The council must be disgraced to take action, because they are useless to deal with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were driven away, and now they're back again.
They came in last night, probably even more today."
He added: "The Council of Governors knows how to deal with such things by getting long seals to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook, and I'm not happy to keep paying council tax if the council can't even stop such a thing."
A local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said: "This is ridiculous, and we only saw the last ones leaving the travelers, and there's already a new offensive.
This time, the number has grown and even the horse has been seen in the grassland.
The representative of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware that there is an unacceptable campsite near Streetsbrook Road, and we are working with the Solihull police, and we will take the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible.
The collection of evidence is of great help if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling at 101.
It helps to create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them."
The Weekend festival is also visited by the Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, who is pleased that the top names of the world have been brought to Estonia.
The question of why the Weekend festival is so important for Estonians, Saar responds that it should be asked by all those who enjoy the festival's three days' story to the fullest.
However, he admits that real players in their field have arrived in Pärnu.
"While looking at the level of the artists that have been brought to Estonia, the absolute top names of this genre of music will be brought home - this often does not happen in our area," the Minister of Culture says.
What kind of festival are the artists who speak most about Saart?
I consider myself a relatively old man and for old people like me, one of the most experienced artists Armin van Buuren, who performed last night, is definitely one of the most experienced artists.
According to his record twist, at some point, everyone has twisted our feet," he says.
However, he also points out several names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifes.
Of course, our own Estonian makers: starting with NO-P and they can be read in a number.
In reality, this concentration of well-known names is very high," he says.

Audi renews up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the middle of the criticism of car manufacturers
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said that it offers more than 350 000 vehicles for software upgrades.
According to the Chairman of the BMW, the company believes that "there are more intelligent variants than driving restrictions," referring to European cities, including the BMW hometown Munich, which has considered the ban or restriction of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would renew three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel engines.
None of the companies described these operations as a recall.
European car manufacturers have been eagerly promoting the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitric oxide from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
The cost of the equipment to be installed for the emission of electric vehicles for the air of diesel vehicles for automotive companies is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under thorough investigation, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of chereasing the government of powerful car manufacturers and disregarding signs of a problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen's mistakes, who remained silent about the use of deceptive devices, which made it possible to adapt the exhaust gas reading to comply with the regulations during the car testing, but withdrew from normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been prosecuted in the United States and others are on both sides of the Atlantic under investigation.
Last month, the former head of the sub-ordination division of the Audi Engine Development Department was arrested in Germany.
Former Head of the former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be brought to justice in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was pulled into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany when the authorities accused the Audit of installing the system in order to circumvent the requirements of European exhaust gas emissions, thereby extending the investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the research may be a major blow for Volkswagen - a luxury car manufacturer generates a disproportionately large part of Volkswagen's profits.
The flags of the European Union are purchased for 20,000 euros for Estonian schools.
The Ministry of Education intends to buy the flags of the European Union to Estonian schools by 1 September to indicate the presidency.
A total of 570 educational institutions will receive 105x158 centimetres of the flag of the European Union.
The flags are intended for indoor display, they must be carried out in high-quality printing techniques with tunnel confirmation in indoors, mediated by the news portal of ERR.
The flag's label contains the text: "The gift to Estonian schools to note the first presidency of the Council of the European Union in Estonia.
The estimated cost of the 570 flag is 20,000 euros at the price of the Ministry of Education, i.e. one flag costs 35 euros.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat situation in Mexico
The workers of the weekly Riodoce usually gather on Wednesdays to review the plans to reflect the most recent chaos of the state of Sinaloa, sown by organised crime, corrupt officials and endless drug wars.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own security.
They're told it's important to change your routines.
Two older writers will discuss which seems safer: to bring the children to the office that was the target of the grenade attack in 2009 or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the board at the head of the room: "enemy," "neutral," "litre."
They ask reporters to provide names in each column - no evidence is required, impressions and in-in-fastness are enough.
Drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists are suspected of being on the payroll of government or cartels - a whole list of bad guys who make the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
There is no breather from violence, and the more bodies are piled up across the country, most of them are made up by journalists - according to the Committee of the Defense Committee of the Journalists, they have been killed since the oath of President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 at least 25,589 journalists have been protected after attacks and threats, and during this year at least seven journalists have been killed in seven states.
The last casualties include their editor and source of inspiration, Javier Valdez Cardenas, co-founder of Riodoce.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence gives a deep feeling, although his presence can be perceived everywhere - on the facade of the Riodoce building, a big picture of Valdez, showing his finger with "Justice" and two reporters in the 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts depicting his face with smiling glasses or a characteristic pancrop.
The meeting will take place less than two months after his death, reporters will discuss common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate Public Prosecutor's Office was established to deal with the cases of journalists in 2010, only two cases have been prosecuted according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
Like most annual murders related to drug trafficking and organised crime, the number of thousands, the killers of journalists rarely come to justice.
Riodoce continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, even though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the data of murderers and justice, the security meeting, Ibarra said, is of great use.
"It's very stupid to waste your time at this meeting," he says.
"As long as the reason is unknown, you distrust everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, the state, on the morning of May 15.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before two of the men stopped his red Toyota Corolla, and forced him to leave the car and was shot 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper, which means translated into the "twelfth river."
An armed man drove away in Valdez's car and crashed it around.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumors spread freely in Culiacan.
But on Valdez, there is only silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as the rival clicks are fighting for the performance of a power vacuum.
It doesn't matter that on the streets of Sinaloa, a few people or even several people are shot every day, or that the cemetery is crawling with abundancely decorated with double drug kings, which are larger than many living homes.
Let us forget for a moment that the period of peace indicates that only one cartel is led by a cartel with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States of America.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of his work, the co-founder and manager of Riodce, Ismail Bojorquez (60) knows the enormous remorse that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes encouraged murder.
The first was the publication of an interview with the boss Damaso Lopez in February, a cartel competing with Guzman's sons and is at war.
This piece of paper may have angered the cubs - suspected gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they got to the newsstands.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after the raid in another newspaper that covered the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would be there forever.
He worked at the Noroeste newspaper in 2003 as a veteran reporter when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50-dollar units.
Bojorquez said that Sinaloas "it was impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem."
Over time, the newspaper gained fame with its bold and honest coverage, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to publish strong research without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication from which they could read about stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after the founding Riodoce, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for her Latin American coverage.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award for the International Press Freedom of the Journalists (AKK) to follow the Mexican drug history wherever it leads.
He admitted openly that he was afraid.
"I want to live," he said by accepting the AKK Award.
Last October, he told the TV channel Rompeviento TV that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
"You have to accept the task of the journalistic office - another way to play a fool.
I don't want to be asked what I did when I faced so many deaths or why I didn't tell you what was going on."
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the joker who cursing like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared embraces and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went across the office to El Guayabo's bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if his routine love was fatal to him.
His death has also made them doubt how to do his work best and to survive.
"They don't like it when you mess with their women, their children, their legal businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs."
"There were no such things to be touched," Bojorquez said.
The result is even in the best times strong self-censorship and self-confidence.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
According to the editor of Riodoce, Andres Villarreal, the problem is that "the sense of smell can be deceived... and that's how this thing happened to Javier."
He and the others say that the English no longer applies the old rules in Sinaloa, just as they do not apply to the poisonous community of profitable smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where the workers of Riodce met for security training, mobile phones were no longer allowed; a few days before that, it was revealed that only spyware sold to governments had been used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists.
Two policemen in front of the house were looking for relief from a 40-degree heat in the shade of a tree.
The government appointed them to guard the Riodoce office in a four-storey building in the Culiacan Central Sector.
Some reporters wondered half-naked whether these police officers belong to the 50 percent of the police, the governor himself has stamped unreliable.
Several months have passed since the reporters have travelled to mountainous countryside, where de facto drug gangs are in the hands of de facto drug gangs.
Riodoce this week's publication dealt with three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the former boxing agent Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story of spending government money on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were abducted from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan's office in the D.A.'s office.
There was no official statement about who was abducted or how it happened, so it came to be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows - restaurant is both a place of minds for drug traders and authorities.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered as a politician, who is part of the Institutional Revolution Party (IRP) in power, which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the previous century.
Recently, several IRP governors have been accused of widespread coverage of corruption in the context of cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, including how the nicknamed Guzman's son, who is holding El Chapo, escaped the military mat.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have been looking for the column of Valdez to get information about kidnapping from the best sources.
"We would have known what happened," said the 46-year-old Villarreal, whose body building has earned him nickname El Flaco.
"Now all channels of communication have been broken with our sources.
Valdez's office has received a storage room for signs and stickers that protest against the murder of journalists, and the editorial staff has become something they never expected for the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to the local prosecutor's office the next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after the murder of Valdez.
The body has been found, and the officials say it belongs to him based on the DNA tests.
Journalists have become more vocal all over the country and are squeaking as an organized protest to the pavement and buildings the phrase "SOS press."
On this day, President Bojorquez will be away in Washington, D.C., trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's death, when he met the governor of your permission, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that, he asked him to redirect from the government's activities to be redirected from the government's activities, worrying that his anger had influenced his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were "in limited" by organised crime, accomplice of complicit officials and indifferent society.
In his latest book "Narcoural Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by orders from politicians and security forces who are in a gang of organised crime.
Last year, the media monitoring group Articulo 19 awarded more than half of the attacks of journalists to the police and state officials.
"You die in a Mexican because you're going to be silenced," Ramirez said.
The murders obviously have a blood charm.
No one forgets the death of bloggers Maria Elizabeth Macias in Tamaulipas, the northern border state, six years ago.
His body was found with a letter probably signed by the cartel Los Zetas: "I'm here for my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lied next to his cut-off head.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in Chihuahua, the northern border state of Chihua after the murder of their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others will keep going as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their manager in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke to the drug prayers with the editorial "What do you want from us?" on the cover.
Some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country.
It's a nerve-eating decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still have to gaze on the streets to avoid dangers.
And sometimes they're behind them, as probably happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in 2015 in a Mexican apartment three months after he fled Veracruz.
Those who remain in place and continue to work have to dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that reflecting the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico is on his way to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At the end of the recent Friday at midnight, when the latest number had already been locked, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and sifted beer when suddenly everyone started vibrating.
According to confirmed data from the rival gangs and security forces in Mazatlan, the beach resort town was 19 people.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by several messages from the cartels found in the area.
From the very same sidewalk, reporters put the news on the mobile phone up to the Riodoce website.
The front cover for the next day needed to be changed.
Sirens were wandering - another firefight area.
Bojorquez was peeking at the police station to see if they're vigilant.
When they were scared, they didn't show it at least.
Under the massive portrait of the fallen founder, where his average finger is visible to the whole Sinaloa, the workers of Riodce delivered in his footsteps.
"How could you even think about closing," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send him to the streets to report him on the streets?"
Dinosaur used a protective colour to prevent enemies
At first glance, it seems like a statue, albeit rather scary.
Scientists have now published the first findings in connection with the incredible rhino size of the Canadian miner, which has been so well preserved, that the experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinucleus."
It is so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that his skin covered with armouredness was a reddish-brown color and his past had been somewhat "wrong."
The report published in Current Biology described the creature as "the best preserved armored annumaurus ever found" and as "one of the best dinosaur input in the world."
Phossile is a new species of Nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous age 110-112 million years ago.
The unbelievably good preservation of this struck the researchers who describe it as "truely significant."
This trooped vegetarian, according to the National Geographic magazine, is best preserved by this type of fossil that has ever been found.
It was found on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined at the Suncor Millenium mine at Fort McMurray near North Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that didn't resemble the surrounding stone, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The next six years were worked on devoured the animal from the 2500-pound pig (100 kilograms).
After all this hard work, the end result is now finally ready to be brought to the public.
"If you squint a little bit, you can almost believe that he's sleeping," said Caleb Brown, the researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is exhibited.
"It goes to the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisana of the dinosaurs.
When studying his skin, the researchers found that this plant-eating agent, although covered with scales and recalls a walking tank, was likely to be significantly threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
This dinosaur with many armoured species used red and white protective paint to hide from predators, and applied a shading technique called a eclipse, and also used by many modern animals.
According to experts, this made it possible for the dinosaur to blend better into the surroundings and avoid enemies, as the larger dinosaurs probably hunted him.
This 110 million-year-old creature of the Nodosaur family reached the news for the first time in May and is now visited at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The researchers have now studied the creature and named it after Mark Mitchell, a laboratory at the Borealopelta Marmitchelli Museum, who spent more than 7000 hours on the animal to reveal the arduously.
Thanks to the amazingly good preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the armoredness on the animal's body.
They discovered an opposing eclipse - a method of protection common in the animal kingdom, which means that the top half of the creature was darker than the bottom.
Although the eclipse is common, the findings come as a surprise, as Borealopelta is much greater than the animals living today with an eclipse.
This suggests that the dinosaur was hunted enough by other carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution preferred to hide in survival instead of confrontation.
However, most of the modern animals that use anti-ecsports - e.g. deer, zebras or scarves - are much smaller and more vulnerable as a prey, suggesting that nodosaurus had to really work hard to survive.
"The vigorous hunting of a dinosaur covered with enormous and many armoured shows how dangerous the Cretaceous dinosaurs could be predators," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the armour revealed that the dinosaur's skin was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal in order to get clues about this life, including the content of its intestine, to find out what the animal would eat for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river when he died, thereby reaching the sea with the flow, where he sank his back in front of the ocean.
At that time Alberta was as warm as it is now in South Florida, and the rivers and oceans were likely to extend farther inland than they are now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable, as it is fully covered with preserved scaly skin, while also remaining three-dimensional, while retaining the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"As a result, the animal today looks almost the same as in the Cretaceous age.
To reconstruct it, you don't have to use a lot of imagination - it's just squinting your eyes, and it seems like he's sleeping."
The Cretaceous era was a time when the vast carnivorous dinosaurs - terop shops - were wandering on Earth on Earth.
Although the rex of all of these kings Tyrannosaurus lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, some of his terrifying predecessors could hunt down this armored dinosaur.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and six tons of a monster.
Scientists, whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was washed after the death of the sea and this mummified mud.
The creature was discovered on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined at the Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaurus in the world, including skin and armor, and it is a complete cone to the hips.
These beings were on average 18 feet (five metres) long and weighed up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
Its shoulders were infiltrated by two 20 inches of spike.
Scientists believe that this armoured plant-eater adventured through the present Western Canada, until the flooded river washed its open sea of holes.
But the dinosaur's burying site helped to maintain its scales in detail.
The hardened remnants of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the bumpy armored plates along the dinosaur skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic: "Such a degree of preservation is as rare as a lottery win.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
The petiful remains still cover the bumpy armored plates on the animal's skull.
The right front leg lies next to him and five toes are stretched upwards.
I can count the scales on his stables."
How did an activist find an answer to the question "Who Streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was fully shocked.
Just the day after travelling to New York, this resident of St. Louis sat on a bed in a room rentd through Airbnb, browsing Facebook on the phone.
He got caught in a post of his former schoolmate.
It said, "Police just killed an 18-year-old, and he still lies on the street."
He was confused about why no one else had posted this information in his stream, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
TheePharoah user's posts had been repeatedly redistributed on his timeline.
A rapper from St. Louis's area broadcasts real-time tweet Michael Brown about the death of an unarmed 18-year-old black young man killed by a white cop in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, remaining there for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell thought of himself.
But death was nothing new to him or his community.
He put his phone away, but later he saw the tweets again in the evening, which announced this time about the gathering of people on Canfield Drive.
Photos of the policebird and the screaming people and the man who claimed to be Brown's father and kept the sign "Ferguson Police just killed my unarmed son!"
He looked at the real-time stream where the police stood in front of a protestor group with a barking dog.
In the second video, another cop, he said, pulled a gun and shouted, "I'm gonna kill you all... animals."
Ferrelli remembers how he caught himself in mind: "It's unusual."
"This is not the kind of murder we are accustomed to and what we could call a typical."
I felt the creeps of fear at that point.
I was angry and cried.
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
Having landed at 11:00, he went to see his father to pick up his six-year-old daughter and decided that they would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What took place with Ferrelli and Ferguson in the next three years is the central theme in the new documentary "Whose Streets?" ("Who Streets?"), which will be premiered in cinemas on August 11th.
It is the story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and strength from the point of view of those people who live in this community and who filled the streets in demand.
When Ferrell and his daughter - wearing a flowery dress and a suitable crown in his head - he drove to Ferguson, they again talked about what had been discussed several times before this morning - about the experiences and conditions of the Blacks.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights?" she reminds me of herself asking.
"We're driving Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"I couldn't take him with me," Ferrell said later.
"What's going on right now is... the culmination of what happened in the past.
He needs to know and see it and grow in the middle of it.
He must learn about activism and organisation, and at the same time also know the different layers of the experience and living conditions of black people and what we have to do to get free and free ourselves.
Even if I can raise him so that he does not experience personal blatant racism, he is no different from another black girl.
I feel like I would do him a disservice if I would protect him from this world.
The first stop they made when Ferguson arrived was on the road to South Florissant - a place across the road from the police station, which had become a campsite of a kind, where the activists were waiting for news about policeman Darren Wilson, who was not finally charged.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who made lunches.
They assembled the grocery bags and helped to share them with protestors.
For Ferrelli, a new type of activism began to slowly take shape.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," he said, noting that when he was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, he was the President of the Minority Association of Nursing Students and focused on food justice and health-related inequalities in black communities.
"I had no organizational experience.
It's all just worked out.
A week later, during the evening demonstration, Ferrell met with one of the film's co-directors, Sabaah Folayani.
Folayan said that he and the filmmaker Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what was happening.
The question arose in Ferrelli's head: "Are you trying to document what is happening or find a story that can be exploited?"
This scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white people - come to the community and try to benefit from its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We have heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson is not heard and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already been hit by his co-director Damon Davis, a local artist who was known for his activism in connection with death sentenced prisoners.
His involvement made the project attracted to Ferrelli and six other locals that were watched by the film "Whose Streets?" for years after the shooting of Brown.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or for us, but we speak to ourselves," Davis said.
"It was important to me how these people are portrayed, as this is how I is depicted."
Although the goal was not to focus on Ferrelli's experience - it was intended to show that the movement was not a "revealer guide, but about the community," as Folayan said - he became the most open part of the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrelli's life, such as falling in love and marrying your wife, will document.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing at the first time he saw the film.
"But I realized that this work and the humanization of black people must be accompanied by certain vulnerability."
What's more, Ferrelli's story re-empty homosexual woman plays the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators of the movements, who, in 2012, formed on social media after the murder of the black teenager Trayvon Martin, are homosexual.
"The Muslim homosexual women in the current role have kept the movement in general," Ferrell said, "and this is because we have to fight on several fronts all the time.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden."
Folayan agreed noting that "the movement is really kept alive by black women, and many of them are black homosexual women."
At the same time, he argues that "making is not a thing of any type of equal chance creation" - Ferrelli was not chosen as the centre of the film because of his identity.
"He was a person who blew up the right energy," he said.
"But it is no coincidence that he was right on the front line, because as a black homosexual woman living in such hubs, there is a lot at stake when living in such hubs.
His energy can be perceived through the screen."
At the same time, the news cameras have long disappeared from Ferguson, but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
The conditional sentence imposed on Ferrelli during the demonstration for blocking the road will last for another 2.5 years.
He describes the socio-political atmosphere in the area he calls home, just a "threatening threat."
Nevertheless, he still attaches importance to the mantra he has been etched in memory since he went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
7 tricks to get over the hangover after the Weekend party
Some of the strongest men's cubs will find after a booze party, after a booze-long party, of what a problem, that's for help.
Or you're looking for "leave hangover, stay drunk."
But it's just an inevitable postponement and a decent baby on health.
What can you do to feel better in the morning and get over the hangover as painless as possible after today and the Weekend of Tomorrow's Weekend - to feel better in the morning?
Drink some water.
Down on the alcohol and after the big party in the morning... or, if possible, instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses a lot of fluids when using alcohol, it has to be somehow recovered.
With water, minerals are washed out of the body and therefore it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often upset after drinking, it is especially good if it is bubble-free or only slightly carbonated.
Go for a walk.
You certainly should not go to Grandma's house to break trees - it can be a fatal false decision.
But a light walk helps your body to remember what it's like to be alive again.
Falling in the tent and getting out is a more time-consuming way of healing.
Give the body energy back gradually and carefully.
When you're already throwing up overjoying last night, you don't want to try to load a big grease steak in the stomach.
Start, for example, from fresh juice, which contains fruit sugars to quietly revive your body.
If health is already suffering around noon, you should try, for example, broth.
And a little later on.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic will free your body from the last water.
As has already been said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you take an analgesic to prevent a hangover in the evening, your liver will have to deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol and lose its performance.
So you ruin your liver even more, and in the future, the hangovers are worse.
Plus, the painkiller doesn't stay in the body for long anyway.
If you take an analgesic in the morning, don't do it on an empty stomach - it will irritate your already squashy stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, you're well with yourself.
It works like walking, but you can't have an orgasm when you walk.
However, avoid too active pace and outrageous poses - during a hangover, physical exertion should be moderate.
You're kidding me.
Talk to friends and co-spirites, make simple stupid and laugh friendly about yourself and others (carnatures).
The joke and the laughter may not make you hang on, but it's definitely fun to take on what they're helping.
One day, the hangover's gonna go away anyway!
Northwestern professor and Oxford University employee are wanted as suspects of murder
According to the police, a professor at the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford, who have become suspects after finding a deadly stab wounded male body in one of Chicago's luxury apartments, is being searched.
According to the Cook County Court papers, on Monday, warrants for arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew, were issued for the arrest of the first degree, due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated stabbing.
According to the warning issued by the Chicago Police Department to the community, the body was discovered on July 27.
The police received a phone call and found a victim of a funeral when they arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment building, whose body had several puncture wounds.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene and investigators are concerned with stabbing as murder, while the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as a co-professional in microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of Public Relations of the University, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem has now been temporarily suspended and has been banned from entering the campuses of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal case under investigation by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University is working with investigators," Cubbage said.
Warren is an senior assistant at the University of Oxford's financial department.
A representative of the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and ready to help U.S. research institutions in every possible way."
In addition, the statement stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wished he'd give himself up.
Anthony Guglielmi, Head of Communications at the Chicago Police Department, urges suspects to turn himself in to the authorities.
"The police have an idea where they are, but we are increasingly intensively defining the exact location," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, the suspects are being sought by local, regional and national authorities.
Guglielmi said that the police received a phone call from the administrator of the Grand Plaza apartment building, who had just received a cryptic tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
According to the police, it was a hideous sight.
Guglielm argues that it is unclear whether the event itself also took place on 27 July.
He said the security cameras confirmed Lathem and Warren's presence in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi added.
The Grand Plaza management sent a letter to the residents: "The police are currently working on the chronology of events and the background of the victim and are studying various motives, including the possibility that this was a family dispute."
Start-ups that can help your business avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce start-up, but the polls were ineffective.
The answers were often vague, useless, or worse, even worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
"This system simply was not consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs Madison Reed, an e-commerce company selling hair care products in San Francisco with 75 employees.
So he called for the help of external individuals.
New types of human resources start-ups are in practice that help companies to find out what their employees know.
By developing and licensed software, the purpose of which is to measure the involvement of employees, they enable companies to conduct sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, to provide anonymity and a hot line of complaints to employees, and in some cases to allow language carriers to pass C-level managers and to contact directly the board.
"There are now tools such as Strava and Fitbit, which are designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City's start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies using software analytics tools to measure employee involvement.
According to Errett, he has received a much better overview of what his employees think and feel in three years, when he has used Glint.
In addition to sudden surveys and surveys aimed at specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company, which gives an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, enabling him to identify the reasons.
Companies have begun to realize that they need to stay up to date with their work culture, so as not to become the next Uber, which has been wrapped in scandals since a former employee published a blog post that described the harassing environment where those who dared to speak.
For start-ups such as Glint, the desire to have an overview is a profitable business opportunity.
The global area of governance, regulation and compliance may be worth more than USD 18.7 billion by 2020 according to the data of the FinTech Statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
Convercent, a start-up in Colorado, Denver, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, observed interest and increased activity against the backdrop of Uber's dubious reputation this year.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a customer.
Like Glintki, Convercent lets companies send customized impulse surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and view heatcards from problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous messaging line that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when it comes to the CEO, the complaints go directly to the board.
"The choice of opinion has been accompanied by regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
Quinlan said that if a company is found to treat its employees poorly or behaves unethically, the company may face serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, employee departure and lawsuits, even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 sites, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employee awareness of the rules and activities and provide an easy way to communicate with the headquarters of the corporation.
If an employee wanted to report a problem earlier, he had to find the phone number or email address of the headquarters of the corporation, file an official complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a daunting and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday's Master Adviser James Vitrano, who said there was no good way to monitor employee complaints.
However, now that the company is using Convercent, problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair payroll practices, which did not reach the managers who were active in offices in other cities or states more quickly, identify and deal with them.
"I can get closer to the territorial 360-degree experience of the employees," said Vitrano, who runs the risk management team at Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from litigation with employees.
Quinlan said that the companies began to take ethical behaviour, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, i.e. after the auditing company Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations in connection with the Enron scandal.
But only when "social media matured," the companies realised that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from being online in public.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service by taking up a periodic fee from companies for using their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been supported by both start-ups.
In February, Convercent was financed by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, increasing the capital raised to 47 million dollars.
Glint invested 10 million dollars in Bessemer Venture Partners in November, increasing the total funding of the company to 60 million dollars.
Such investments do not come as a surprise, given the interconnectedness of companies, culture and venture capital.
More and more research shows that modern workers expect more from the workplace than before.
In competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, there are high wages and interesting projects just on the table.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy in the company, they feel that they are being listened to and that the work they do is rewarding, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, who is the vice president of the general benefit and employee experience department in LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn income when companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If the third-party analytics tools allow the commitment and involvement of employees to increase, it is no wonder that they will find support.
Having data on employee involvement is important, according to the experts in the work culture.
However, this data is useless if the company supervisors do nothing with them.
In fact, if the company asks for feedback from its employees, it may create expectations that changes await.
And if the changes do not happen quickly or not at all, this can lead to frustration and reduce employee involvement.
"If you ask for a proposal of 4,000, you need to be ready for 4,000 conversations," said the President of Kotter International, Paul Raath, who has seen how companies make a mistake in relying too much on data collection.
"Because if things aren't taken to the end, the employees are wondering, "Did you actually hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?" "
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly research among employees, has been able to take measures on the same day as the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from employees disappointed in the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganise several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with problems.
Ruby Tuesday, however, collects new data on employees and hopes that in the long term, it will lead to a long-term commitment of employees in the industry, known for its high labour turnover.
"If you are not committed to ensuring transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose the companies."
The bright star of the euro area is Baltic: income is growing rapidly
Although the 2008 crisis and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic states are rapidly approaching the incomes of Western Europe's rich countries, Bloomberg writes, referring to the report of the European Central Bank.
According to the central bank, the total annual production of the economy per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
Progress is due to low debt burdens, fast-established institutions and business and free market-friendly policies.
"The Baltic countries, along with Slovakia, are among the few euro area countries where real-GDP per capita from purchasing power has significantly approached the EU average," the central bank said.
Although the goal is that the total annual production of the economy per capita would be equal to the richer Western Europe, in 2015 the total production of the Baltic economies per capita accounted for only 2/3 of the average of 15 countries that belonged to the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led to the Baltics looking for better wages from abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic States in a positive light and the economy is growing this year, local residents are not enthusiastic at all.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the population of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies are doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, this was considered by a little less than half of the polls about the economies of their countries.
NCAA's decision to cancel workouts twice a day makes Bruins's days long
It's almost 23 o'clock, when UCLA footballers stop at the edge of the new training field on the team campus for a chat.
Some of them have peeled their shirt off, revealing their first day of training camp with sweaty back.
For a large part of the team, these idle minutes offer a noon break.
Players will take part in the summer courses after three hours of training to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Centre for meetings at 6:30 p.m. next morning.
"The next three days is a real challenge for them," said Bruins' coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
NCAA's decision to cancel workouts twice a day to reduce the burden on players has actually made their days longer - at least until they are finished until they are finished on Friday.
For this reason, the first three trainings of UCLA were scheduled to begin at 19.15 to fit into the already busy schedule of players.
The transition from two training days per day means more workout days - the beginning of Bruins's training camp was raised almost a week ahead of last season, and for the first time during the six Westwood seasons of Mora, training takes place during summer courses.
They are scheduled for 18 workouts until 20 August before the formal preparation for the opening match against Texas A&M in September begins.
Mora said he was in favour of a change of rule of NCAA, although it adds another item to players' tight charts.
"They have a huge burden on three or four days and this is a serious challenge," Mora said.
"And they will break through this ordeal; they will struggle; they are great young.
I believe that when it arrives on Saturday and we have more time, it will be really nice."
When the camp is over, UCLA's training will be closed, which is not at all an easy task, considering the clear view of their squares from a nearby parking lot and the bystander Luskni Centre, a higher-class hotel that has already been hit with football through the surrounding defence network of the gatepost.
Since this weekend, Bruins players at the hotel, but Mora admitted that problems may arise during the season.
"Let's pick up security," Mora said.
"This is a real concern and it is not exaggerated to think that people can rent a room and film training there.
If you have a record of your training, you can make a pretty good deal with it.
But we're gonna use security teams in that and 8th parking lot.
We do our best by using what we have.
I'm trying not to worry about that.
We have a plan in place.
The Savisaare-Ivanova election coalition, born to the Centre Party, Kristiina Ojuland, who was retired from the Reform Party, and the election coalition of our Tallinn and the political parties, created on the initiative of the people of the Republic of Estonia, who was forced to leave the Reform Party, and the election coalitions created on the initiative of the people who have been able to leave the forces of Maria Kaljuste will take at least as many political parties this year.
However, chicks are considered in the autumn, and the key issue becomes whether there are enough voters of needy disappointed to all of them.
Who's staying with Savisaar?
If the supporter of Edgar Savisaar has decreased to small, the events organised in honour of his election coalition may be anticipated.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and current central parties and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the election coalition?
And is the reason why some of Savisaar's faithful followers and friends are evaded by the people who are applying in Tallinn, whether the reason why the people who are applying in Tallinn can be found to be the "Savisaare List," led by corrupters and suspected corruption crimes, become a reality?
A music video of Russian-language pop songs, filmed on the roof of the city government, in which the elder of the Lasnamäe district participates; and in all respects, the primitive computer game in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, the protagonist, must the pups and squirrels on the bike - does the Centre Party, for the first time, catch the votes of 16- and 17-year-old voters allowed to be allowed to ballot boxes?
We will wait for the idea of other parties's youth election campaign.
If the viewer of Channel 2 or TV3 is faced with a black square instead of an entertainment show from the beginning of August, there are two options left to accept that only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and English-language France24 can be distributed every month for a tenth time.
There are probably also those who at first enjoy the ad-free television experience in the open, but in the end, even if reluctantly - pay for the television image and advertisements.
The music, the noisy people and the junk left on the streets are unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you don't want to be part of the forest, but instead of hurting your head at home, it is worth leaving your homeland to discover the homeland - and the sleeping place for a hefty amount.
Washington changes the rules of the green card
Media outlets quote President Donald Trump, who says that a new U.S. immigration plan is planned, which changes the rules of the green card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants for 50,000 people per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary working methods and restrictions in relation to family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and the President supports them.
The bill goes to the congressional council to be discussed in two chambers.
"This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars in taxpayers' money, as it changes the way in which the US issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law reduces chain migration and begins to replace the current programme.
The new application process gives an advantage to candidates who speak English and have the funds to support themselves and skills that benefit our economy," Trump said, according to the media outlets in the United States.
The young people of the Siberian Seto move to the city, the pensioners return to the country.
Jevseyev Anatoly continues the tradition of the famous Seto gold miners along the former River of Maana.
He works at the starden carad at the River of the Land River on the River Eel Show from home as a driver.
It's a tough job: two months in a row without days off, 12 hours of work, and then only ten days at home and back again.
During the three years worked in Artelli, Anatoly has only seen gold once.
"There is a hard time: when you go in, it is thoroughly checked that the vodka does not bring along, and when going out, so that the gold would not be taken with you," says Anatoly.
Mare Piho was talking to the local Seto Jaan in Haida village, who has told him a lot about the memories of his family in Siberia.
The archaic culture, which has yet preserved Siberian Setos, will also affect home-settles, because it is just so fabulous, thinks most thoroughly Piho Mare, who studied the remote Setoes.
His first research trip to Siberia is 30 years this year.
During this time, he's been there 14 times and lived there for a total of one year.
How many settlements still traveled to Siberia at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century to get land here?
This is an unresolved question.
I'm saying 8,000.
I calculated it by the stories of Siberian Seto men, who themselves have thought about it.
It's hard to say, because at the time, up to 30 people could come in one group, but the passport was given only to a man.
The passport was given only to one, but with him there were children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look how big this territory was here!
It was several times larger than the historical Setomara.
It was necessary to educate, manage in some way.
Setos came here as peasants, but their lives changed, because here they ended up in areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (villag rafting), gold mines, industry.
For example, in Uus-Petseri, many Setos later went to work in a classified city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (the RIS enrichment plant - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did Seto make up the majority of the population in the region at the time?
Yeah, they lived compact.
In addition, the tradition of getting married and a plurality remained long.
Seven-eight children in the family were common.
How much did the Siberian Seto culture differ and differ from that of the sediments of the motherland?
They're different, though what was brought here was once the same.
They brought a lot of folk costumes.
They also did themselves (criminal clothing), but they always made a difference between what had been brought along and what had been done here.
Climate change strongly affected the traditional clothing of the Setos, because it is colder here.
The food changed.
For example, the meat was salted in Setomaa, but it was just frozen here.
Where are the villages of Siberian Setos and what life is lived there? / Graphics: Alari Paluots
The communication with the motherland was mentally strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now it is starting to give Setoumaa back there, starting to influence them.
Those girls who have lived in these families have listened to amazing stories.
Piho means the people of the Estonian Seto delegation who came to Haida village for the Day of the Kingdom of Seto at the beginning of July and lived in homes for four days - J. P.
What's left here, it's amazing.
"It is easy to come to and go to Tapa, as the city has a great location: at the railway hub and at the intersection of the highways," says Reigo Tamm, Opera solo from Tapa.
The city is no longer just a military capital for a long time, we have a lot of nature, sports and culture sites, and pizza can be obtained at any corner.
Kill is a top-notch city!
There is a small island near the White River passing through the city, where the slayers tend to have a Midsummer Party.
"This beautiful place does not appear from the train window," Reigo smiles.
Those who are not afraid of cold water can swim in this river, because the river is full of sources.
I've been swimming there, I'm fine!
On the edge of the river, you can have a picnic and just do romance - you can look at the flow of the river and think about life in advance and back.
I've been walking with my girlfriends, too.
Ooperisolist Tamm, besides everything else, has been on the river bank to practice his arias between the three bridges: "Because this place is by the city, no one may even meet if you hum to his stories."
"The game hill overlooks Tapa, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in winter and play disc golf course now - the golf course has been made, disks can be rented from the fitness centre," Reigo leads.
The old pros, of course, go there with their disks, but I haven't been able to play yet.
I think you have to invite my colleague Rasmus Kull to Tapa, because he is an experienced disc golfer and has disks.
I think he's gonna lend me!
Reigo and Männikumägi were inseparable from the age of the present opera suit.
At least during ski lessons.
There are many tears, disappointments left on this mountain, and you can be in my sports life.
Not to mention broken sleds and skis.
"The whole city centre is now full of construction works, all this changes beyond recognition," Reigo praises.
The old and tired station building of Tapa is a very attractive place where summer discoveries are played.
I am glad that in 2012 Märt Meos, the head of R.A.A.A.AM., met my idea and came to the station to make a summer theatre in the station.
Although this year's theatre season "Aleksei Karenini" was just over, on August 11 there will be "Faret" at the railway station, when the old station building is moving around the 1980s.
"Up to August 11, there are the days of Tapa, during which, in addition to the station building, the open home cafes have awakened the station building and there will be a series of cultural events, including the national race," says Reigo, who recommends a visit to the city of 91 years in those days.
The museum has been on the 1st May Avenue in a small house since 1994.
"The house is small, but there are a lot of ex-ponaments and there is a huge amount of information," Reigo praises the place full of the history of Tapa, most of which focuses on railways and warfare.
Reigo smiles that if you go through all the recommended places in Tapa, the stomach will get empty in the long run, but fortunately, the small town is full of cafes.
"We have such good restaurants and sometimes when you're sitting in cafes, you get the feeling that you're abroad," he describes.
The soldiers who have come to Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, so sitting there is a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and in your hometown, but this is the whole of an international group.
I believe it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we have a lot!
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The television channel was quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who announced that two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece.
On the morning of August 1, the police arrested a group of people who illegally camped on the Sithonia peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but there's an investigation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the TV channel bTV that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free camping and are already imposing harsh fines for anyone who gets caught resting in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
The wolves who teach puppies go to break sheep.
Hiiumaa farmers have to give the wolves "learning material" from their herd again after a year's break - wolves who probably taught puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, the wolves in Hiiu County have broken sheep three times, a total of 23 sheep and have injured eight, writes Hiiu Leht.
Last year, the number was only three, 124 a year earlier.
The data of the Environmental Agency is also synchronized with the breakages, that last year, wolf litters were not born in Hiiumaa and the information of the Hiiumaa hunting council that two wolf nests have been fixed on the island this year.
At night against Monday, the wolves broke 15 sheep in Kabuna village of Emmaste and injured 18 surviving sheep.
In the early morning of Wednesday, the wolves broke one sheep in the pasture of the village of Reheselja and severely injured the other, to whom the trouble had to be made.
The rules for handling genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft Act on the Release of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOVS) and the Plant Protection Act to the coordination round.
The amendment to the Act will abandon the creation of a separate database for the locations of both genetically modified (GM) crops and operators, for which the plant health register will be used for this purpose.
In addition, the GM crop operator will be amended to have a prior agreement on a time limit for the apiculture person.
Although GM crops are currently not grown in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for coexistence of GM and non-modified crops.
This is at least until it is decided to declare Estonia GMO-free," said Sigmar Suu, Head of the Plant Health Department of the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"However, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be purposeful and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burdens of both the private and public sectors," said Suu.
The Bill repeals the provisions relating to the database and handling of the location and handling of GM crops in GMOS, and the requirements for the commencement of economic activities with GM crops.
Specifically as regards the apiculture in relation to apiculture, the GM crop farmer's current obligation to inform the GM of the planting of the arable beekeepers from the obligation to reach an agreement with the beekeeper before starting the cultivation is started.
The Bill has been sent to ministries for approval.
All interested parties have the opportunity to examine it in the information system of the Bills and, if they wish, to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The planned changes affect, in particular, persons active in the field of plant production, beekeepers and the Agricultural Board.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop - MON 810 maize - is allowed to be grown.
However, no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing the GM crop.
The reason for this is that there is no corn pest in Estonia, a European boar, for which MON 810 maize is resistant.
The varieties of this cornline have also been bred to the southern regions, and this in May is not suitable for our climatic conditions.
In order to obtain the fortress, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has ordered studies in 2015 and 2016 for the detection of possible pollution with GM organisms in seeds of different varieties of zucchini, maize and soya grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain foreign genes and as a result of the study it was concluded that the seeds of oilseed rape, maize and soybean varieties grown in Estonia do not contain GMOs.
From the above, it can be concluded that consciously GM crops are not consciously grown in Estonia and it was also confirmed that there has been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruited a "genius" in Nemanja Matic's form.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has recruited a "genius" in the form of Nemanja Maticu, after the midfielder Sampdoria made his debut on Wednesday night.
A player bought over from Chelsea for 40 million pounds started in United's final game before the Uefa Super Cup Real Madrid in a 2-1 launch lineup on Tuesday, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on an attack.
But, apart from the Blues preseason Asian tour, Maticul was desperately lacking in the form of a match, and he lasted only 45 minutes, according to Mourinho, he has to repair it before the Premier League season begins.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, a brilliant way of thinking - he has a football friend," Mourinho said.
"We can help him achieve the form as soon as possible."
Like Matic, other new recruited Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started to play in the starting season, and Mourinho began to settle his own man starting by the beginning of the season.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three footballers, but she confirmed that the club has already done a "excellent work" by concluding contracts with three of his four priority options.
"I am grateful to the club that they were able to realize three out of four," he added.
"I'm even happier if they can make four out of four, but they've worked hard for me."
Another tsunami son got a GSM transmitter on 1 August and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, a clawed birdwatcher, the first storkson was equipped with a singer, and this litter is already flying around, has left the nest and joined the large collection of overnight stays in Mullu-Suurlah.
This is because there is no grain field in Sõrve, writes the Voice of Saarte.
This Tuesday, to ring the cranes relatively late, another stork boy got attached to the transmitter, on Muhu Island.
According to Martinson, the installation of escorts is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a stork named Mati GSM was supplied with a pigeon Türju.
"His doings are all watching on the Internet: how he went to Spain to winter, returning to the German and Polish border for a long time and then came to Saaremaa," Martinson said.
The British inventor had a microchip installed in his body to get into the house and car with a hand gesture.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to which a microchip was installed, so that he could open his back, get into the office and even start the car with a hand gesture.
33-year-old Steven Northam had a tiny chip between his thumb and forefinger, and now offers this service to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant-anesthedologist at the Royal Hospital in Zhents, Zants, Winchester, to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of the microchip installed in cats and dogs, and only 30 seconds for the procedure.
The Northami company also changes locks on houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, asking for 300 pounds for one lock.
This father of a married child has now installed technology in both the home and in his car BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the steering wheel.
White House exhibit cost taxpayers thousands
According to military documents published to the magazine TIME, the White House decided to fly a naval helicopter to the southern courtyard for the event of American production last month, taxpayers cost as much as 24,000 dollars.
The Green and White Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One during the President's onboard, was the central attraction of the event in the White House on July 17th in the White House.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and White House senior officials, looked at industrial products from all 50 states in their tour.
The helicopter, built in Connecticut, was exhibited together with a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift made in Mississippi.
According to the documents of the squadron, Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House War War Office demanded a part of the helicopter, i.e. FARGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the south yard for a "unbearing" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of it, because it was an unusually large-respect event," said HMX-1 commander in the e-mail to his boss, the deputy naval commander in the field of aviation.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive at the south court at 7 a.m. at 3:00 p.m. and would remain there until the yard was cleaned between 18 and 21 o'clock on the same evening.
The fact that if leaving the White House should be delayed, a second pair of epices was needed for the return flight due to the restrictions on working time.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event and the squadron's security team remained close to the aircraft throughout its entire time of presence on the ground.
It was not possible to read from the documents given to the magazine TIME whether the second crew was finally needed or not.
Hatch's law prohibits federal workers from using government property for political purposes.
Documents show that HMX-1 has examined whether this event could violate this setting.
"We asked if it violated Hatch's law, and we were told not to break," the commander wrote.
"It seems that you have no choice," said the deputy officer of the lead.
The White House declared the event "made in America" as an official event, and Hatch's law would not have covered it.
But even official events have political undertones.
The President supported the efforts of the health reform during the Senate at the event and praised the efforts to keep government regulations in control.
The use of the aircraft known as the Marine One or Air Force One for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely for a photo session is unusual.
Trump was underlined in February when his first campaign in Melbourne, Florida, Florida, was undermined, and his Twitter account is crawling with messages complaining about how his predecessor used the president's plane.
"The House is very pleased with the display "made in America," where products were represented from all 50 states made by American workers from American materials," said Lindsay Walters, Acting spokesperson of the White House House.
HMX-1 teams often do test flights around Washington and south yards to practice putting the President of the United States at the White House in a centimetre accuracy.
When Trump was at the G20 Summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 held 58 attempts in the courtyard of the White House.
According to the official, the flight to the event "made in America" was included in the norm of the flight crew of the month.
The squadron helicopters also flew 11 hours for the "prior-related support missions" on that day.
According to the White House, no other exhibit of this event burdened the taxpayer's wallet.
According to Sikorsky's representative, the company was not involved in organising an exhibition in the south yard of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not maintain the budget documents of the President's flights, and the exact costs of the event are difficult to identify.
However, according to the hourly rates of the Ministry of Defence for the 2017 financial year, the compensation rate for VH-3D is 24,380 dollars per flight hour.
The squadron's records were marked as the length of the flight from its main base from the Navy Quantico Airport in both directions for 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is well below its sum.
"The calculation of the costs of the applicants on the basis of the estimated compensation rates is very misleading," Walters said.
"These estimated compensation rates shall include staff, maintenance and much other irreversible expenditure to be taken into account for the annual appropriations.";
According to the RAND survey in 2015, the compensation rates of the Ministry of Defence do not include staff costs, but they cover the costs of fuel, maintenance and contracts.
Former White House spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter at the time.
"It's the idea of showing things made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of contributing to our national security and that there are expected hundreds, if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So, of course, it is right to highlight it."
It is unclear whether Trump was in contact with a helicopter or not in the south yard, acting as a helicopter, but he sat behind the wheel of the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump turned to the representatives of Sikorsky, giving the media films to make fun of the company's products in his own fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of their products."
Grit Sheadeiko - peace and joy arrived through tears
At the 2011 World Cup, Daegus hit the last area of Sheadeiko, 800 m of foot cramp, and a gurney was taken away from the stadium with a gurney.
Immediately before, he had received a zero jump in the dive of the universe held in China.
Helsinki EM was ruined by the 2012 low-cost injury, but at the debut Olympics held in London, he won 23rd place with 6013 points.
The misfortune, however, continued.
At the 2013 Moscow World Cup, the Estonian record-hearted Estonian record was injured in the long jump.
Two years later, he took 15th place at the Beijing World Cup and filled the Olympic norm, but it was more disappointing to the athlete.
The hardest cadle was passed until last year, when he did not receive a result in the long jump of Amsterdam at the beginning.
I just want to put together a proper multi-competition, even once.
One time," confessed to the Sheadeiko.
The worst was still ahead: a month later, his Olympic competition in Rio was interrupted due to a thigh injury at the first barrier.
The time had to be taken down - can we continue with the 7th competition?
Is it worth all this for two days?
She thought for a long time, but found peace.
I got my head cleaned up.
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I've been thinking that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal yourself and to think clean.
"I knew I'm not gonna bag up the pills yet," says Sheadeiko about his self-cleaning.
I got to turn the paper and move on with a new momentum.
According to Coach Anne Mägi, it was very difficult to look at the suffering of the ward, but she realised that the athlete had to find out first and foremost.
He was so buried by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
"Grit said he wouldn't give up, and he wants to prove to himself what he deserves," Mägi says.
Now he's some kind of peace.
He's doing it for his pleasure.
The competition came back in May, when Sheadeiko set 6280 points for a new Estonian record in Götzis's multi-competition.
In a high-level competition, he improved his personal top brand bulletpull with nearly a metre (13.89) and ran in a near-peak hurdles.
Then a multi-athlete sensed that it was not a ceiling of abilities, but was erased by the only first starvation.
Mägi, who supervised him for years, says that Sheadeiko is a traditional student.
He's a ready athlete, he's good to train.
If something's wrong or if he's wrong, he's gonna say it now.
He feels his own body and trusts his own feeling.
That's what we have to do.
I can't tell you exactly what to do, and we'll follow it.
The new approach has also been found by the Shadeiko.
"I'm not the kind of person who makes the most in practice," he says and says that the most important thing is to get the right feeling, because it also guarantees a good result.
Close baby happiness makes happy
Good emotions have also been offered to the wife's happiness.
Both her former training partner Maris Mägi and sister Grete recently became parents and several competitors have received support from new citizens of the world.
"It's been interesting," says Sheadeiko.
One alcohol whose drinking equals the "training" of the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big wine fan that he believes - wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
According to him, it is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather in the process of flavouring "very active" wine.
Smelling the glass, spinning the wine in the mouth, enjoying it and sensing the aftertaste, we make our brain work to create a taste for the wine.
According to Sheperd, the wine molecules do not actually contain any taste, but the taste is formed from the way the wine stimulates the brain.
He brings to comparison how the brain "sees" colors.
"There is no taste in wine, the taste is created by a taste of wine," Sheperd says.
Things that still affect the formation of the wine taste are, for example, our age, gender and even the amount of saliva that a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, admonishes that wine is not to get drunk.
"There must be more in reality," he says.
If you take too much sip, the system is oversaturated.
Excessive drinking wine may harm the brain instead of profit - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine, memory loss, loss of balance and reduced mental capacity are risking.

According to the UN, democracy in Africans depends on the role of women in politics

A trip from the Philippines to the heart of fashion fans of the world, or the shoulder bag
The straw braided bags are a summer classic, which has become a kind of hit product in recent years, which has to hang on one of the right summer lovers and on which merchants have been able to weld a price tag according to the hit, despite its modest origin, has been able to weld the price tag.
A bag of straw is probably one of those things that have existed every once in their life and the possession of which has not caused special emotions.
It's just there, and if it isn't, there's nothing broken.
Now, the shoulder bags are making a real triumph, and fashion fans have exchanged their fancy designer bags for summer months with simple reddened bags.
It is not just a beach bag at all, but today it is just as popular as a street bag, and the bravest women even walk into the office.
However, it is worth knowing here beforehand whether the summer look like this to the boss is sitting or if it is worth pushing the martyr and laptop to a slightly more formal sumadani.
However, the diversity of straw bags has made women's true love of women.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing to see is that fashion gourmets take the first thing on a holiday trip to the local market and acquire a few shoulders on which they are faithful to the whole holiday period and which accompany the beach, the market and also girlfriends hanging out on the city.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy bags from the market for a larger pile and sell or give them to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting that there is so high demand for bags among readers that women (and men!) in the real world would probably go hand to get the happy owner of some bags.
In some ways, this kind of madness is also understandable, because rare times, when it is possible to buy a few ten euros in a hit status in the fashion world.
True, clever merchants have also discovered a simple way of serving money, and this is how finer luxury brands sell beer bags for some time and thousands of euros.
Probably just so that richer customers don't have to feel like a simple mortal who promensing around with some cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy a shoulder bag paying more than a thousand euros in Dolce & Gabbana.
However, Chanel's shoulder bag interpretation can be rounded around EUR 6000.
Unlike most fashion giants, shoulder bags do not come from some great fashion mecca, but their story began from a distance.
Namely, the shoulder bags are supposed to come from a far away from the Philippines, where they have been carried out in the wide world.
The redundance of a straw bag is primarily an ex-sports business and the locals are not even dizzy with them very often.
Suple-buttoning techniques come from the 14th century and are quite hazel with ordinary baskets.
However, since the shoulder bag does not have to be as hard as a basket, they can be brushed with patterns and other materials that make the bag more personal and, by that, more actuarial.
For example, recently there are particularly trendy bags with coloured ribbons or leather strips braided in.
The best hand, the shoulder bags can be sent to actress Jane Birkin, the biggest braided shoulder fan had never been seen before.
Namely, he matched the shoulder bag to all sorts of outfits and did not have to go much with it even to the Cannes Film Festival.
Today, the popularity of bags is not a minor role, but the fact that caring for them is a rooster is not a rooster and unlike all other sumadants, they do not need to be cared for by special means, but also water and wet towels.
As usual in the case of trend-feeding, after classic-looking brands, they have come up with all sorts of interpretations.
For example, you can buy a spitula from straw or a tiny shoulder bag, if you wish.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that the classic shoulder bag never goes out of fashion, but it's a shoulder.
But what is the classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, a bag of straw braids has been considered classic, reminiscent of the basket in its style, is open from the top and is short, as well as straw, handles.

GMB is worried about investing in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The trade union expects drivers from the leaders of the cookie manufacturer McVitie to confirm the long-term production plans at the Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has remained silent about the future of the Tollcross object investment.
The factory employs more than 500 people in Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, said that they have invested more than GBP 5 million in the last few years.
There were more employees and the union chairmen "there are the first to hear" when something changes in the factory's activities.
In a letter to the company's site manager, Mr. Unitedside addressed a request to "replace the concerns about the fact that the funding is not used to modernise production lines."
Drew Duffy, Senior Organizer of GMB, said: "The fact that we are not getting any clarity from the head of the object about Tollcross's business needs and the investment plan for the future, is deeply concerned about our members.
Several generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is largely made up of local communities and people around Glasgow, as an indispensable pillar for proper employment in an area where high unemployment and there is social deprivation.
Thus, in the light of the jobs, wages and well-being in the east of Glasgow, and Brexit, the increase in living expenses and the chronic decline in production, McVitie, urgently needs a strong-growing return company.
The Pladian representative said: "The object manager of customscross was only received from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company responds directly to it, as we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting between employees and representatives of GMB took place in Tollcross, where several problems were discussed openly.
We then discussed with the workers that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and precarious economic climate, we are reviewing our activities on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all our companies and objects - to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years, we have invested over GBP 5 million in the Tollcross object, most of it has gone into production lines and improvements in operations.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcross as a production site, and if there are any changes in the activity of the object, the employees and the trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it."
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about the approach to Neymar?
La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up in the quest to lure Neymar into his ranks by making an offer of GBP 189 million to buy him out, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago for this record conquest trip?
This gossip approach has opened the summer transition window, and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break more than double the current world record of over-purchase, which was set last season by returning Paul Pogba to Manchester for GBP 89 million.
Once the transition is completed, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and also the most highly paid professional athlete in the world, who will receive a salary from PSG after payment of over 500 000 pounds per week.
Barcelona is also aware of the way of convergence as well as the break-up of Neymar, although a source close to the board of Catalans confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the footballer since his arrival in Santos in 2013.
But did the President of the PSG warn the world of football about such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing a contract with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif strongly warned all the clubs thinking about recruiting some of the best players in the PSG.
"I'm not worried, because they know that if they touch one of our players, we will meet them and contact them," Al-Khelaif said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to enter into a contract with one of our players, they will have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this border, as the Spanish club previously showed interest in PSG's midfielder Marco Verratt this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could be rebound as a result of this interest, losing one of its precious assets in Neymar's form.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexit, not borders.
"Brexit threatens to seriously wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland," Varadkar warned during his first visit to Northern Ireland after his or her inauguration in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made it possible to make the current free movement of people and goods, Varadkar said.
"This is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not borders," he stressed.
According to Varadkari, he would prefer to remain a part of the European Union, and since it is not possible, remaining part of the European single market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way of making the departure of Great Britain smoother would be the creation of the European Union's and the United Kingdom's customs union, explained the Irish Prime Minister.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "We could definitely have such a great deal with Britain."
An alternative to this would be a return to customs points that would declare historical division and political failure.
"Trust to trade, prosperity and peace," said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit a "both generation challenge" and warned that its result could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's everyday life.
The Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland when visiting Belfast.
Märt Avandi, who has completed his first half-long triathlon: Ironman can go through anyone.
Today, the largest triathlon festival in the Baltics was held in the winter capital Otepää, when about a thousand triathletes from thirty countries were located in the semi-long Ironman competition.
The 70.3 miles long distance consisted of 1.9 km from swimming, 90 km from cycling and 11.1 km from cycling.
Among others, Märt Avandi ended the first triathlon of his life.
"I thought it would be difficult and eventually it was difficult," said Avand in the finish line.
Despite the complexity, Avandi stated that in fact the triathlon is feasible for almost everyone.
"Not-taken distance, it kills the pace," he said, implying that at an affordable pace, almost everyone reaches the finish line.
Except for Ott Sepp: "Oti's physical body is fine, but unfortunately he can't swim."
Avandi had been working out since February.
At first, 4-5 hours a week, later ten hours a week.
With the time of 05:34:12, he reached 270th place overall.
Although Avandi lost to both Raio Piiroja (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Ligi (time 05:06:37), he won other competitors in the so-called "promines class."
Tanel Padar, who was a "good example person" last year, lost to Avand in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (time 06:31:53 and 06:45:18), respectively).
The total winner of the score of the Otepää stage, a German Johannes Moldan was crowned the winner of the choir stage of Ironman with 3:58:27, the best of Estonians was Ivo the Great with time 04:14:09.
Among the women, the Dane Helle Frederiksen triumphed in 04:24:01, and the Estonians won Maria Jänes, who lost to Frederiksen in nearly half an hour and became at 04:58:58.
The opening was completed by a swimming distance of 1.9 km in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water in position 410.
