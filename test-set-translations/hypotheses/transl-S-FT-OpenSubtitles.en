I'll give you 50 bucks and a new bike.
We're never going to leave, never!
Okay, buddy, are you ready to go?
I finished the conservatory, I have a rich inner life!
I don't know this man.
I made my request in an absurd form.
Oh, for the heat of the day.
Who knows? It might be fun.
Therefore, the whirlpools held them in place.

I do it all the time.
I'm not afraid now.
I can smell the garden.
I really like what you're saying.
They're running.
What's with the kitchen thing?
I'm going to find out what's across that door.
I need some advice.
