Four members of the Kemerovo group were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to Postimees, the police detained Slava Gulevich, the head of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in the Estonian alley, in Spain, and known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovski.
Gulevich, detained in Spain, was arrested with the permission of the court.
Yesterday, the court also seized three suspects in Estonia seized.
According to the suspicion, these are members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal organisation aged 27-57, who mainly commit drug crimes.
The alleged leader of the criminal organisation was detained in Mijas, Malaga, Spain, in Malaga, Spain.
Three men were detained as a suspect in Estonia, one of which, according to the data collected, is the leading figure of the criminal association and two are members of the criminal organisation.
The data collected indicates that tasks and roles were clearly distributed in the criminal organisation.
The purpose of the activities of the criminal association was to commit drug crimes and thereby earn criminal proceeds," commented Vahur Verte, Head of Pre-trial Proceedings on the criminal case, the head of pre-trial proceedings, the State Prosecutor.
"We do not rule out the increase in the circle of suspects in this criminal case," the prosecutor added.
These are people who have previously been interested in the interest of law enforcement authorities, and some of them have been punished for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us and this week's operation shows the success of the cooperation," commented Prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, Head of the Central Criminal Police Department, said that the detentions were preceded by a preliminary investigation lasting for nearly a year and a half.
"In the first half of the week, long-term work materialised and we detained suspect crimes in Estonia and Spain at the same time," he said.
Leis added that officials of the Central Criminal Police helped in detention in Spain.
For years we have good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the civilian Guard.
These detentions are yet another messages to criminals that we can also receive them from the other end of Europe," Leis said.
The information gathered so far clearly indicates that when he was at large, suspected men may continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecutor's office requested their arrest and the court also approved it.
A man arrested in Spain is waiting for him to be handed over to Estonia.
Property, vehicles and cash seized in the context of this criminal case to ensure confiscation.
The pre-trial proceedings of the criminal case are conducted by the Bureau of organised Crimes of the Central Criminal Police and is led by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of blackmail in 2005 and sentenced him to five years" imprisonment.
In the middle of last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world after the then underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, emerged in the underworld of Estonia in the early 1990s, when he began to engage in extortion in Tallinn.
Supposedly, he taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at different hotels and demanded a monthly roof tax from businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscation of criminal proceeds and judgments that have entered into force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the last judgments, eight accused persons separated from the criminal case of the so-called Dikayev criminal association, who confiscated the proceeds of crime of 80 000 euros, or the judgment against nine persons that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal association in 2006 aimed at the illegal trafficking of secret cigarettes and the commission of crimes related to human trafficking in Ida-Viru County and South Estonia.
Confiscated criminal proceeds are nearly 71,500 euros there.
These criminal cases have ensured success by the fact that police officers exchange information and prosecutors with foreign colleagues every day and, if necessary, acts are carried out together in any country of the European Union.
Civil rights group warns about travelling to Missouri
The Organisation National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned against black people travelling to Missouri for discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
The statement of the group states: "The ML travel note issued for the state of the miscellaneous state, which is valid until 28 August 2017, invites all African-American travellers, visitors and missoles to be particularly attentive and extremely careful when moving around the state throughout the state, given the suspicious race-based events that have taken place recently across the state and have also been highlighted here.
According to NAACP, the group encouraged the group to issue a travel warning both by the recent Missouri law, which makes it more difficult to win cases concerning discrimination, as well as the fact that the targets of state law enforcement are minorities unequally largely.
"People's civil rights are violated.
They are pulled on the side of the road due to their color of the skin, beaten or killed," said Rod Chapel, President of the NAACP Missouri branch, to The Kansas City Star.
"We've never been getting such dense complaints before."
This is the first such warning issued by an organization about the state of the United States.
The group referred to events such as racist insults towards black students at the University of Missouri and the death of a 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died this year in half of the beginning of this year, after he ran out of gas when he drove through the state, and the Missouri police took him into custody without being accused of a crime.
In addition, the comment refers to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General, which shows that the state is suspended cars of black drivers 75% more likely than those of white people.
"Note is designed to be aware of and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be prepared, whether it means taking bail money or informing relatives about passing through the state.
Based on the latest data from the FBI hate crime reporting program, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, placing the state in 16th place in the country's cross-section in terms of the number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also in response to a new Missouri law that makes it more difficult to sue a company for discrimination in search of housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union - ACLU had previously issued travel notes on Texas and Arizona after these states passed immigration laws that oblige local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, as ACLU says it would increase racial profiling.
Normally, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issues travel warnings about other countries, but recently interest groups have started to use this measure as a counter-reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Hepatitis: what could anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, may be caused by five different hepatitis virus, A, B, C, D and E.
All of these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, the case with a poor-alcopic cost is chronic hepatitis B and C, which can develop into liver cirrhosis, i.e. liver wrinkles and liver cancer.
Kuuo Kutsar, epidemiology adviser to the Health Board, says that the signs of illnesses of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of inflammation of the liver - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, abdominal pain, grayed stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
The last sign of the disease also comes from the popular name jaundice.
In children, hepatitis may be triggered without signs of disease.
Various species of liver inflammation can only be identified based on laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can transition to chronic hepatitis and go into a disease for decades without signs of the disease, which means that a person may not know anything about his or her dangerous liver-damaging disease.
Kuulo Kutsar highlights different forms of hepatitis and describes their course in more detail.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, by sex, from the impostation of an infected person to hands and hands from the hands, surfaces, objects, mouth-to-us and the use of drugs.
Family members and caregivers of the affected person who are at risk of being infected with hepatitis A, people with chronic liver diseases, infected people who have sex, men who have sex with men, drug addicts, passengers visiting high-spreading countries of hepatitis A.
Infection can be prevented by vaccination, in particular vaccination is recommended for people travelling to a large number of people at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to comply with daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands, wash all fruits and vegetables before using it for food.
Hepatitis B viruses spread to the disease when exposed to human blood, drug injections, tattooing, piercing, blood-infected human (dento brushes, shaving equipment), donor blood blood, sex with a suspect person with hepatitis and from the mother to the foetus/feed-feed.
Injecting drug addicts, sex partners of the infected person, men having sex with men, newborn family members and caregivers of the infected mother, health care workers and other body fluids in contact with blood and other body fluids, and passengers visiting hepatitis B countries with high illness.
In order to prevent hepatitis B, it is possible to vaccinate people; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk and, in addition, persons with chronic liver diseases, HIV-infected, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: avoidance of the use of foreign hygiene and manicure tools, other sharpeners and syringe needles, tattooing and piercing, and condoms in case of sex that is dangerous to complain, or prevent sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation plan in Estonia and free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are transmitted by contact with the blood of the affected person, drug injection, tattooing, piercing, using blood contaminated with blood, or when sex with a patient, and the foetus/infants from the mother to the foetus/infants.
Injective drug addicts, sex partners of an infected person, men who have sex with men, newborn family members and caregivers of the infected mother, health care workers and other body fluids in contact with blood and other body fluids, persons with HIV infection and passengers visiting hepatitis C countries with high illness.
Prevention of hepatitis C is: avoid the use of foreign hygiene and manicure tools, other sharps and syringes and needles, tattooing and piercing, and condom in case of infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
The hepatitis D virus is caused by hepatitis D virus, which is multiplying in the presence of hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in chronic hepatitis B patients.
D hepatitis virus is transmitted by contact with blood and other body fluids, with syringe needles contaminated with them, sexually transmitted and rarely infected from the mother to the fetus.
The risk of hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B carriers and in people who do not have hepatitis B immunity.
An effective prevention measure is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from hepatitis D from infection with the hepatitis D virus.
hepatitis E viruses spread by fecal-oral food with drinking water and food, including low heated beef, fish and shellfish, donor blood, co-administrates and infected mother to the foetus.
Passengers can become infected in E in high-restraint countries.
Preventing hepatitis E preventive measures is to comply with hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after operation in the toilet, before cooking and eating, after the patient's care.
Fruit and vegetables wash before consumption, avoid eating little heat-treated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and refrain from using drugs.
Although in the last round the competitors tried to push the four-time Olympic winner off the track, 34-year-old Farah found strength at the end of the race and won in 26.49.51.
Farah didn't think long, pulling his wife Tania and the children on the track after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
Being on the track was wonderful with them," Farah told the journalists.
Farah targets the fifth title competition in London in a row with a golden double of 10,000 metres.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Da amidd in gold, the extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, a portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer," a much deeper story of the cultural life of Vienna in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
But even more thoroughly in history.
The awe-inspiring amount of information was useful, i.e. a harder cutback axe, a narrower theme that would have been promised to have the exact story more to have had more influence.
At present, there would be two books between the one covers: Gustav Klimt and his painting in "The Lady in Gold" depicted the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer and the much more extensive and comprehensive history book about respected Jewish families and the German occupation, along with its aftereffects in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to the cultural life of Vienna in the middle of the buddies in the middle of the Russian capital, one can easily imagine how more than a hundred years ago life went to Ringstrasse or how Central turned his head all in the cafeteria when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of cultural figures was high in one of the richest cities in Europe and when you see a name familiar in the book, you feel more culturally.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where the uncurable sympathy of guilt and was the highest level of suicide in Europe, as if there was nothing to the development of the story.
Or perhaps, perhaps - every paired brush stroke adds colours to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
Dream of a journey to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost every tenth of Vienna was a Jew.
Adele's parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married the Czech sugar magnate twofold, Ferdinand Blach, and Klimt posed for his famous paintings, his father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adelet's whole glamorous life he didn't bring to.
If you look at "Dam in Gold," it is difficult to believe that, towards the end of his life, this great lady was infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order a portrait of his wife from Klimt, the last moment was the hottest painter in Vienna.
The order of Klimt cost 4,000 kroons at the time, a quarter of the price of a country house with a good location.
The fact that in the case of some portraits, the master's love story was suspected of a model, the sugar magnate did not discourage.
As far as Adelesse is concerned, the only definite fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist created during the work continued for the rest of his life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "Da'am in gold.
The extraordinary story of Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait," Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Immediately before the start of the work with Adele, Klimt had been to San Vita in Ravenna, and researchers think that the brilliant mosaics seen there from Empress Theodora gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adele as a jigsaw puzzle painted from Adele.
Klimt presented his "Dam in Gold" in Vienna in 1908, and at about the same time (in 1907-1908) the second golden painting "Supremacy" was born.
Theories of art did not miss the similarity of two women.
What about the story Hitler?
"I think, in memory of my friend Klimt, I owe him to make his handiwork available to the public," Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after the artist left (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wished that their family's Klimt collection would go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had another portrait of Adele.
In his will (Adele left in February 1925), he also asked his wife to leave his two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscape paintings to the Austrian Gallery.
His jewels were bequeathed to his niece Maria and Luis.
A year after Klimt had graduated "Austria Mona Lisa," Adolf Hitler, 17-year-old, had tried to get to the Academy of Fine Arts of Vienna, but failed the drawing week.
Although Hitler's later anti-Semitism is sometimes considered because the Jewish professors did not accept him to the academy, none of his examiners was actually a Jew.
Anyway, the task of the Austrian Gallery, cited in the will, changed significantly by 1939 - finding the works that they liked the Nazi party from the rich Jewish art collections in Vienna had become important.
Hitler's personal art treasure was also suitable for some of Adele's home, but not by Klimt.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery began with a ten-year-old litigation between the Austrian government and the heirs of Bloch-Baeirs.
At this point, it should only be noted that if "Sugulust" can be seen at Belvedere Castle in Vienna, then "Dabial gold" depicting Adele Bloch-Bair in the "Dabial gold" must be seen at Neue Galerie in New York.
And before the Vienna race, read the aforementioned book.
Even if you don't plan to go see the Klimt's work, because at least my emotions revolved around the painting sold for 135 million dollars after the book closed more Nazi and Jewish theme sold and model Adele Bloch-Bauer.
So not so much the story of the fate of the family - and a very touching story.
Significantly facilitated the orientation of the events by the Lutherans' family tree at the beginning of the book.
A 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In life swimming, Gold was very close to the personal record of his 200 m back swimming 2.16,62.
The top brand dates back to a 17-year-old girl a week since the Canadian junior championship was 2.16,58, mediated by Priit Aavik's Swimming blog.
Gold was the last to the A-finals in the tenth.
In the finals, he went on a distance with 2.15.76 and won the seventh place with a new powerful top brand.
The Estonian record of Alina Kendzior (2.15.13) remained a little over half a second apart from Gold.
In Estonia's all-time ranking, Gold rose third and his fresh personal top brand is the fifth ever result of Estonia.
The young hope for the future is still starting at the Canadian Adult Championships in 100 m, 200 m and 400 m free swimming, 200 m and 400 m complex swimming.
Last week, the Canadian Junior Championships took place in Toronto and Gold also made successful startes there.
He won a silver medal in 200 m free swimming with time 2.03,22.
This distance was last swim so quickly by the Estonian woman in 2008.
Only Elina Partõka, a record-breaking material in Estonia, has swim this distance faster than Gold ever.
The Estonian woman living in Canada also won the bronze medal in 100 m free swimming with a great personal record and 56.66 with the top brand of the new Estonian season.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, a year older than him, has swim this distance by only one century faster.
He reached the top mark of his personal top brand, receiving a letter of 1.03.69 in the opening exchange of message swimming.
On half the long distance, he only won the seventh place when he swam in the finals 2.17,31.
Gold is currently in charge of the Estonian season ranking on four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics sharpening their teeth
The holiday time is here - it also means relaxation for the President of the United States, Donald Trump.
However, since Trump has so far been one of the Presidents who took out the most holiday days, critics are already sharpening their teeth.
According to U.S. Today and CNN, the President plans to spend a 17-day holiday at a golf club named Bedminster in New Jersey.
Although the President's holiday began yesterday, Trump's opponents have been speaking about the holiday for a week.
They blame Trump for too frequent rest.
Namely, it is customary for the President to spend weekends in the villas of his Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
By the way, Trump is not the most rested president during his 196 days of office.
For example, George W. Bush was able to be on vacation for 67 days, Barack Obama, half the size of Trump, only 21 days.
However, things tend to be forgotten quickly on Trump.
The days after becoming president, Trump said on "60 minutes" that there is no time for long holidays during his office, as a lot of needs to be done.
He also resented Barack Obama's holiday three years ago.
The current President wrote on Twitter at the time: "As Obama is on vacation, playing golf, attending parties and jazz concerts, ISIS cuts heads off."
According to White House officials, a 17-day visit to the golf club is not quite a relaxation.
It is officially called a working leave during which Trump does not have time for reading or other favorite activities.
In addition, there had to be another reason on work leave.
Namely, the air conditioning system in the West wing of the White House is replaced, and therefore all the staff had to leave.
The Oval Office and other office spaces of the President are also located in the Western wing.
"I don't think any of you would like to be in the west wing in August if it's 38 degrees and there's no air conditioning," said Lindsay Walters, spokesperson of the White House, who stressed that the President will continue to work during the holiday.
Where President Trump spends 17 days, you'll get an idea of the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook - do not apply for the State Administration if you do not tolerate the criticism of voters
The father of our country knew a lot about the unfavourable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long to beat him up for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Critics naturally upset him.
But he didn't force his critics to remain silent.
Because in 1783, Washington said that "the freedom of word could be taken away from us, and in silent, we could be led to a massacre like sheep."
It brings me to Larry Hogan, Governor of Maryland, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates have blocked and deleted posts by at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And at the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACP) was therefore suing him.
The governor's civil office stamped the action void and the online commentaries were confronted with the counter-reactions in the style "Who is Interesting?."
"It's just Facebook," said many.
But that counts.
And it counts a lot when it comes to a man like Hogan.
It is an amazingly popular Republican governor in a democratic state.
His approval percentage is the second best among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan's not a reactive naphead without thinking.
He has led the state on a firm hand and remained strictly firm in his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook as the main tool in communicating with his constituents quite flickeredly, presenting, for example, after chemotherapy, the head of his bald head for the first time.
Thus, the governor's page is a public forum with official marking, managed by staff receiving taxpayers' dollars - blocking people visiting are unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan's spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's behaviour in an interview with The Washington Post, claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than moderated.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of online fungious internet trolls, spammers or people full of anger.
The Post spoke to several real people who Hogan blocked.
And that's exactly what they are - real people who communicate with their chosen managers, a teacher, a company owner and a pastor, not internet trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not filthy at all.
Pastor quoted the Bible in his post, emphasising Hogan's Catholicism.
Lakshmi Sarma Rani, a lawyer from Bowie, injected not anger, but about real hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed because he had not reacted to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote The Post's news story in the commentary state.
"I also do not like the idea that, if a lot of people comment on the same subject, some immediately call it a collective effort, rather than recognising that it is a great number of concerned citizens."
What the governor's official called "directed spam attack," others probably call "public support."
The Facebook era allows you to easily match messages by simply blocking a critic or erasing a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the old days, when, in order to do the same, workers had to be expelled so that they would collect newspapers with critical editorials and burn them or arrest protesters and force them to remain silent.
But that's exactly what's going on right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first state official criticised for making Facebook and other social media channels blunt.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who are blocked from his Twitter stream.
One of the first judgments of significant significance on this topic was made in Virginia last week.
US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria decided that the chairwoman of the Spolenduni County Oversight Council violated the first amendment of the Constitution when he blocked the voter from his Facebook page.
At Kentucky, ACLU also visited Governor Matt Bevinit (R) for Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
During Washington, affordable postal costs had a similar effect on the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers and anonymous writers plundered his way of driving.
And even then, Washington had to face the anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to the newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, tear Washington's decisions down.
According to historical documents collected in the framework of the online George Washington Letter Collection Project, his office was buried under petitions that criticised his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Great Britain.
But he didn't make them quiet.
Freedom of expression, disagreements and debates are the foundations of our country.
And the right management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for the comfort of the home territory at the Renaissance Club
Former European number one Ronan Rafferty hopes for the comfort of the home territory in the next three days, when the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place on the East Lothian Renaissance Club golf courses.
The Northern Irishman, who was on the neighbouring Archerfield Links trails last year before the fall of Paul Eales, is fond of the new venue and plays the role of the tournament Ambassador instead of Jerry Sarvadi, the founder and CEO of the club.
"I saw how the Renaissance Club was built, and now we can see how the club will shine in full glory with this event," Rafferty said.
"Players see the trail in their best shape, it's in a glorious state.
Jerry's done a great job building this place.
He's an avid supporter of the golf game and is proud of what he has achieved here.
This allows you to show the trail perfectly.
The Englisher Eales is looking forward to defending the championship for the first time, although he has won the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"This is accompanied by a very special feeling," said the player nesting in Southport.
"I couldn't defend my Extremadura Open title because it was taken from the competition calendar a year after my victory.
It's magical to come back to that neighborhood.
It's a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, for me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory, was special.
It was a very special time we will always wear in our hearts.
Gary Orr, who joined the European Tour of mushrooms, returns to the competition on the surface of his homeland again towards the beginning of this year, when he became 50.
This is his first event in Scotland since the participation of Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"To play at home is always a bit more meaningful," said Helensburgh's man Orr.
"You want to perform well, but at the same time you also feel an additional tension.
I've enjoyed playing hard again and shown a pretty good golf game.
I am satisfied with the progression of things so far."
The trio will be joined by former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and muloi-tea tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former captain of the Ryder Cup Sam Torrance are two of the six Scotsman in competition fires, the rest being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free of charge and parking costs a car with one passenger for a car with 5 pounds and two or more passengers to 10 pounds.
All revenues go to the Prostate Cancer UK charity.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's gold-filled land
If Bardina Degei makes dinner, he doesn't use the stove.
He even rarely uses the pot.
In a wooden cottage in Enarotal, the capital of the Papua province of Indonesian Papua, a housewife places a barbecue called nota in local language directly on the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tube is taken from the fire and eagerly put on the skin with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the mud floor - no furniture - and right there he also does his daily household chores, for example, washes the laundry with blurred water from the nearby swamp.
The role of the toilet is performed by a bucket in a room without a roof.
Since he is the youngest of his wife's four women, he is not meant to take care of any field.
Polygamy is common here.
Late work, however, can be dangerous - most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them drink hard, in addition, there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to visit after five o'clock," he says.
This is a rare glimpse of the Papua highlands, which is a former Dutch colony merged under Indonesia in 1969 after a referendum that caused controversy, during which only 1026 elderly people were forced to vote in front of the occupants.
The movement, which incited the death of the Dutch, quickly directed their rage against the Jakarta government, which still keeps the region under its strong control, keeping away from foreign journalists and human rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Paapua and West Paapua, so that the independent Papuua Uus-Guinea remained in the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a single distant and abandoned place, and you have to fly from Jayapura, the capital of the province to Nabire for 90 minutes, and then go through a five-hour journey to a car that makes it nauseous with a rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city with a population of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and cover wavy iron roofs, the rust of which has turned different shade into yellowish browns.
Very few Indians have taken the journey here, not to mention journalists, nor have almost foreigners been here at all.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, Mee Pago's papude the god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing such clothes," says Degei, referring to the hand-woven turban, dark blouse and bright skirt.
"Before we wore plant leaves on the body."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line, and the statistics on infant mortality and illiteracy are one of the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian, gold-filled land.
Just 100 km from Pania, about New Jersey's mountainous province with 153 000 inhabitants, is home to the world's largest and most profitable gold mine Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran, Phoenix.
In 2015, Freeport extracted from here of USD 1.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can be ab boasted of consumer timber reserves with an estimated US USD 78 billion.
But these riches are the source of papute suffering, as they necessitate the suffocating presence of the mighty Indonesian army.
A 2005 study by The New York Times showed that Freeport paid around USD 20 million to local military and military units between 1998 and 2004, including up to USD 150,000 to one officer.
Papuas's aspirations to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden geese and go over them mercilessly.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 papuats have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass killing in the highlands of the Papua tribes in the 1970s was the size of genocide.
Last year alone, more than 3,900 peaceful protesters were arrested by the Indonesian police in the area.
The 2016 report "We're losing all" by the Archbishopric of Birsbane contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (one of the other reports, rape and electric shocks are particularly common) and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims, because such incidents take place every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian investigator at Human Rights Watch.
The screws have been turned on more strongly, as Papua's natural resources have caused the inflow of new settlers from elsewhere from Indonesia.
83% of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but the demographics are changing because Muslim economic migrants arrive from the crowded islands of Jaava, Kalimantani, Sumatra and Sulawes.
Java children's family canteens sell gado-gado with crispy and mixed vegetables, which are served with peanut sauce.
The locals can't compete with them.
"Migrants began to sell chicken and vegetables cheaper than local paputies on the traditional market," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old born in Pania, who moved to Jayapura, the capital of the province for work.
"Pearth of oil, papua, mama-ma's [women] - therefore loses their market share."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, promised to deal with these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua in his election campaign for 2014.
27 of the 29 constituency of Papua, including Paniai, the former carpenter won Jakarta's presidential palace on his way.
But there's been very little change in Papua, and the locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokow in anticipation that he would meet our hopes in connection with the restoration of justice," says You.
In fact, Paniai struggled at a low position just two months after Jokowi's October took office.
On 7 December 2014, 11 children sang Christmas songs by the fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on the motorcycle from the darkness.
The courtesy kids told them they should turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended to their tone of their voice and later returned with four soldiers.
Victims and eyewitnesses say drunk soldiers chased the children and beat them with the handles of their guns.
Then one of the soldiers shot among the kids.
One child, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yemo, was beaten so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby election committee building was set on fire, and the next day things escalate further.
Approximately 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered to demand justice on a football field in front of the local police station and military command centre.
They wore ceremonial hunting vinaiten and presented the patronage of the Papua honey pago tribal dance, during which they ran around and the bird song was imitated.
Some protesters started throwing stones at the police and military people.
"If the crowd resists more than three times, let them down," was said according to an official document that the magazine TIME has seen, but which has not been issued to local media outlets.
Yeremias Kayame (56), the elder of the Kego Koto district of Enarotal city, sensed the threat and called for peace to remain, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen to.
"Returns, I was suddenly shot on the left wrist," he told the magazine TIME on the veranda of the wooden house in his vivid colours.
Kayame still doesn't know who was the shooter, but says the bullet came from the assembled soldiers.
"There was a lot of people, there were plenty of shots," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw got hit three times by a cousin who witnessed his shooting.
"I came to him and studied his body to make sure that it was with him," said Yohanes, who uses only one name like many Indonesians.
"I saw that he's dead... I kissed him."
Head Inspector Yotje Mende of Papua Police told reporters that his subordinates only returned to the safety of his department because it was attacked.
"We need to defend ourselves if we are threatened to kill," said Commissar Pudjo Sulistiyo, spokesperson for the Papuaua Police in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and were a lot of injured.
News on the killings didn't reach Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokow Jayapura gave a passionate speech, where she expressed sympathy to the victims' families and promised to deal with abuses in Papua.
"I want to solve this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of Security Wiranto said that he would establish an out-of-court mechanism for the resolution of crimes against human rights.
But almost immediately, the apologies followed.
"Most crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The thing is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we must follow certain processes," he said.
However, when talking about TIME on 5 June in Jakarta, Wiranto took back his words, saying that he had no intention of creating a mechanism for dealing with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said that "everything will be resolved by law."
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of anti-human rights crimes in connection with the death of more than 1,000 people in East Timor in the course of the 1999 bloody independence referendum, said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been solved in Papua, including those in Pania.
The families of Paniai's victims were against such claims with gloomy mistrust.
"I have been interrogated four times over the last three years, but no progress has taken place," Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that Paniai's people are afraid of this incident.
He said he got beaten up by the army after he helped bury four victims.
"After burying the bodies, the army came looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't ceased.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighbouring Regent of Paniai in Deiyai.
One person was killed and 17 were wounded, including children, when he went into a fight between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to transport an unconscious man to the hospital.
This male, a 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, drowned in a nearby river trying to fish, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested on the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones with policemen, on which the last responded with warning shots.
But according to the locals, the mobile brigade (Indonesian-powered police) began to shoot at the people, killing one person.
"We are in great panic, we are afraid of revenge," said Dominggu Badii, 29-year-old, to TIME magazine, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the entry of the injured.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police officers involved and the withdrawal of the police's mobile brigade from the region.
Paniai has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of thoughtful development feeds the discontent of the tribes of honey, mon, dan, and damal living in the humiding central mountainous land of Papua.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL) - the rebel army, which, according to him, protects the rights of papuats, organising attacks and kidnapping attacks among Indonesian soldiers in the event.
Some of the leaders of VPL come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, under the pretext of "protection of the state's sovereignty," the army has arrested Paniai in recent years and arbitrarily detained thousands of people.
Some of them will never show up again.
Paniaid is known among the people of Papua as a "traagily forgotten place."
Poverty feeds discontent.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive to buy for the locals.
Bread is just as unavailable.
People grow all their food themselves - mainly sweet potato, in addition to a little fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom is able to maintain four or five sweet potato fields.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten trampants only cost 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between seguerrilla papuas and new migrants have been deepened, which have arrived a lot since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist go to better educated and more prosperous migrants.
Papuai itself often lacks capital or skills necessary to drive a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village, because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Council of Panian Tribals.
The isolation keeps the world's eyes from Papua.
In addition, foreign media remain severely restricted.
At the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Paapua because "they did not follow relevant practices," although they had been given a rare filming permit.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Head of the Asian Department of Human Rights Watch, the election promises of Jokow have not been implemented to abolish the restrictions on reportages to promote transparency and development.
"Indones, Papua's eastern most unsettled provinces and West Paapua reports threatens new threats - rejection of visas and inclusion in the black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of a drilling look of the press means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific countries were encouraged by Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "multi- widespread crimes" in Papua, including the shooting of Paniai.
These same countries have historically supported the VPL.
Arrmanatha Nasir, spokesperson for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, dismissed the accusations of the group, saying to Jakarta's journalists: "Indonesone still has democratic order and freedom of the press, so that the evidence of human rights cases would be difficult to bury."
Local people want more foreign governments to notice.
When the official delegation of the Netherlands, led by the country's human rights ambassador Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, the local people interrupted the meeting, but according to the source who wanted to remain anonymous, asking for his silence: "We want freedom."
In Indonesia, new presidential elections will take place in 2019, but papuas do not believe that they will vote again for Jokow.
"Jokow is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Paniai," says Hobai, Chairman of the Council of Tribals.
He wants to tell Jokow that, in addition to the fact that Paniai people are constantly living under the threat of predatory army, they struggle with misdemeanorities due to the educational and health services of Nigeriana.
According to Gobai, Paniai's people, like other paanud, consider their voice to Jokow to be the debt he has to pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, the families of Paniai's shooting victims managed to resist the last symbolic rebellion - they buried the body of one of the victims against the police station and the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be put on their feet, at least they will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus with a felled head.
"What else can we do?"
The fire took over the second time in the skylight.
On Friday, the fire swooped through one of the highest residential buildings in the world in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee this 337-metre high and 79-storey building.
This is the second fire that has devastated the high-kick for only two years, which happens to be called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injury was reported and no direct cause of the fire was presented.
"We slept and woke up to the fire alarm and the screaming of people.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said Reuters a resident who called himself George.
According to Dubai civil protection officials, firefighters erased the flame at about 4 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they're working to get shelter for the victims.
This incident may once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the outer surface of high-buildlery.
During the investigation carried out after the fire of the Board of Torchi in 2015, it was found that the facade coating - decorative panels and insulation of the outer surface suffered the most damage.
The British police have said that they believe that the insulation and facade panels of the Grenfell Tower in London could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire that acted there in June, in which approximately 80 people died.
See: These phones will probably be the sales hits in the autumn
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for technical fans, because then phone manufacturers will disclose their new top models.
In the spring, Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium were on sale, and new hit phones are expected on store shelves in the autumn.
According to Kristjan Seema, the marketing and sales director of Tele2, this year's flagship is characterised by innovative design, an iris scanner, an edge-to-object with 4K resolution and an ultra-fast processor.
The Samsung Galaxy S8 created great excitement in the world of technology, which has also reached the top of the Estonian smartphone sales ranking.
Autumn promises even faster fast charging, a more durable battery, a higher quality camera and a higher water and dust resistance for smart lovers.
He added that, on the basis of rumors, conjectures can already be made and four top models can be predicted, which will probably conquer this year's sales charts.
These four top smartphone models reach the supermarkets in the autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach the store shelves already in mid-September.
Rumors, however, what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it spreads a lot.
If iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences next to iPhone 6s, Apple's tenth birthday is expected to be completely distinguished from the previous ones.
Four colours have been said: black, white, pink gold and chrome.
One of the elements of the new design is probably the display covering the entire front panel of the phone, the home button has been lost and the fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
JonyIve, Apple's design manager, requires the new iPhone model to look like smooth glass.
There has also been talk of the ceramic version of iPhone.
In addition to the idione scanner, wireless charging and a higher-quality camera, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
It's definitely one year of the most anticipated smartphones.
The brand new model Galaxy Note 8 preorder starts on August 23.
There have been many rumors about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
I hear it's even more designed for a business user and the S Pen delivers even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one with a wide angle and the other a teleobjective with a narrower field of view.
At present, no one knows why the two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, it is Samsung's first test, which is definitely comparable to iPhone 8.
However, we look forward to 23 August.
Although Nokia has been sold this year by three smartphones at the head of Nokia 6, their flagship - Nokia 8, which will be presented already on 16 August.
We expect a 5.3-inch edge-to-side display and ultra-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processors and a more durable battery from Nokia.
Nokia is also responsible for the aluminium body and the significant level of water and dust resistance IP68.
Like Samsung, Nokia's new model has two rear cameras, the optics of which are produced by Zeiss.
If Sony's certain flagship has been XZ Premium so far, the manufacturer has confirmed that in the near future, at least two smartphones will be added, with even more innovative features.
We look forward to a smartphone that is a bit more modest than XZ Premium, but at least as good or better.
It has been speculated on the new Sony model that its screen is at least six inches.
What the reality brings we will be able to see soon, because traditionally Sony has published its autumn flagship at the IFA, which will take place from 1 to 6 September this year.
According to the leaked transcripts of phone calls, Trump pressed Mexico on paying for the border wall.
The Washington Post unveiled transcripts of phone calls between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and the Mexican and Australian heads of state.
On January 27, Trump went on a phone call to the President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nietio, that the latter would stop declaring the public that he did not intend to pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of America fried him for the public condemnation of the wall, saying, "You must not say it to the press."
Trump set up his presidential campaign's promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and swore that Mexico would pay for this project.
The transcripts of his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published, revealing a tense debate.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States of America would take on refugees heading to Australia was "semite," "spoor" and "distance." He claimed that the agreement made during the Obama government would give him the impression of "passender" as he has proposed a ban on resettlement refugees to the United States.
Trump finished his speech, declaring to Turnbull that "there was the most unpleasant speech of the day."
The Supreme Court did not discuss the complaint of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid in the case where the city of Tartu rejected their offer for bus services from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a directive that rejected the offer of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid in Tartu bus procurement, as the offer did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, Head of Tartu City Government Law Office.
This is a public bus route in the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
MRP Linna Bussicheed to the Supreme Court for the judgment of the Tartu Circuit Court.
The Supreme Court did not take it to deal with it.
Although many complain on social media that the noise from the Weekend festival disturbs their nighttime and the whole city is full of drunken partyers, there are many people who have no bad words to say about the festival on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised that the partyers were so polite in the store!
I didn't see any blurry or rudeness.
I even saw kindness," says the Persian Wave.
"It's nice to come, be and enjoy Pärnu, which has remained like a hibernation in the winter," he adds joy.
Wave sleep does not bother.
While living in the city centre, he always heard that music was played on the beach, now the music has not yet reached his home walls.
"But I hope I hear," he says happyly.
Agnes, who also spoke to Õhtuleht, says that the big festival is rather good for Pärnu - after all, it contributes significantly to the circulation of local merchants.
In addition, he rejoices that so many Estonians have come to visit the summer capital.
The party-homeyy woman won't bother.
Even though I don't take a tan on the beach anymore, but I'm glad the beach has been living.
And it's nice that the people are moving and that's already been the case three times," she says.
The first time, I guess it was a little worse.
"Then maybe there were complaints," he contemplates.
However, according to him, the fun on the beach is common for the summer allies.
"This Weekend is a very good promo for our little town," says Harri, basic in the park.
Meteor and action haven't kicked his rhythm of life into the abundance.
But what about?
We should all stick together.
Think of how this interdection would be better.
You don't rub a man of music.
It doesn't bother, even though I live in the area around it.
"Good people can save and there is no trouble," he says.
According to him, the guests who have come to Pärnu are polite.
"People, of course, they have also exaggerated a bit, but the young are young and my God - let go, but be the people and we can do it!" he says.
The residents by the beach have travelled somewhere away by that time, either to relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival affects life positively - people like this kind of fun," says Tiina, who walked with children in Pärnu.
The music of his family also does not disturb the music of the festival, although last year it came even further than this year.
Last summer, the stage was the other way around, then we heard more.
We live outside the city ourselves that it actually comes quite well to go far to the Pärnu River," he says.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and reduces dividends to revive the business
British educational company Pearson said on Friday that it would cut more 3,000 more jobs and reduce its interim dividends by 72 per cent, thereby launching another restructuring programme to solve the threatening skill of the business.
Workable jobs, which, according to CEO John Fallon, are very likely to be gathered at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, will be added to 4,000 positions lost in the course of the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by a further GBP 300 million (USD 394 million) in the framework of the Third Cost Reduction Programme in order to try to revive a business that has been hit by rapid digital learning transition.
The company, which agreed to sell the holding in Penguin Random House last month to its partner company Bertelsmann, said that their expectation regarding the year had not changed since the sales revenue was reported to GBP 2.05 billion in the first half of the year.

Convoying attack in Kabul: NATO soldier died in a suicide attack
According to officials, the suicide bomber attacked military convoys in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
NATO's statement said that five soldiers and interpreters were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the Qarabagh district of the city.
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence that has hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in the Muslim Mosque on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO statement said that the Thursday-night explosion occurred when the joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked "the man was worn with an explosive device made."
According to the statement, everything is injured in a stable state and is treated at Bagram Airport in a military hospital in the United States military hospital.
According to correspondents, the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) are an increasingly growing source of concern for the forces of NATO in Qarabagh.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which around 20% of them are in the capital.
At the end of July, the car bomb in Kabul mainly killed at least 30 people in the Shiite district.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
On May 31, a major bombing was killed by more than 150 people in the city centre - this has led to the most deaths in the country since US-led troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001.
This violence underlined the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while the President of the United States, Donald Trump, is considering whether to increase the number of US troops helping the country's army and police.
According to correspondents, suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public crisis of confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA annulled the decision to postpone the smog order after the laws of the smog
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EEA) revoked the decision to delay the introduction of a Obama-time regulation requiring states to restrict the supremacy throw-in, one day after 15 states sued the Agency because of its course.
EPA announced its decision to continue with "Acadenomy Determining Operations 2015" late on Wednesday, saying that it demonstrates the Agency's commitment to cooperation with the States.
"We believe that we need to engage in dialogue with our state partners and listen to them," said EPA driver Scott Pruitt in the statement.
The Pruning decision had been notified by EPA in June of the intention to postpone the ozone content determinations - which measure groped pollution in different parts of the country in order to determine where its level should be reduced by one year to October 2018.
15 mainly democratic states brought an action together with the Columbia District on Tuesday, saying that the decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has tried to withdraw a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, and Trump says that it is part of a broader plan to boost economic growth.
But these efforts have created counter-reactions among democrats and nature conservation groups, which are concerned about the effects of increased pollutants on human health.
The EPA website says that the inhalation of ozone air "may decreases lung performance and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases," such as asthma.
German pigs can have a party.
German pigs and cattle may have a party, as heavy rains threaten the harvest of the second largest wheat producer in the European Union, writes Bloomberg.
This year it may be that weeks of rain attacks before harvesting may mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry is only suitable for feed for animals.
"The quality of the bone is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015," said Bernhard Chilla, analyst at Agravis Raiffeisen.
This year, up to 40 per cent of German wheat may become animal feed, which is double compared to the usual one, Agravis predicted.
German farmers, like their European colleagues, have been exposed to all weather this year.
First winter was too dry.
Then the cold spring came, which was replaced by the heat wave in June.
In July, Germany was hit by rain attacks, which have continued in August.
Many eyes are turned to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvesting.
So far, only five percent of wheat has been harvested.
Most of the regions have not even started harvesting, the local collector Ceravis reported.
"There are quite complicated days," said Ceravis' senior trader Frank Deckert from Rendsburg.
Compatibility in everything, i.e. the planled swings of interior design of Finns
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the fair homes, as through large windows the magnificent views of the Saimaa shores reach many (life) rooms.
At each step, the aspiration of our northern neighbours to create both crisps and perfect (energy) homes will stand out.
The skills of using Finnish woods as construction and finishing material, furniture and beauty are worth admiration and adherence.
Vitruding techniques and smart solutions can be found in the fair houses as well as the designer (home) designer.
There is vividly point out that the combinations of black, white and grey shades, if they are supplemented by wood tones and indoor plants, can be very spirited.
Good ideas can be picked up for another week, as the fair lasts until 13 August.
Accessories and herb pots suggest that this kitchen is often cooked.
The night against today, this Weekend Festival Baltic was underlined, and Martin Garrix gave everything he could to remember as the last performer.
The people were really excited during the Garrix performance - they sang, huiled, danced self-forgettingly.
When Garrix finished, the beach of Pärnu was dispersed to the city as a common mass.
We bring you a gallery with all the pictures that our photographer caught in Weekend in three days.
I'm sure you're some of them, too, find yourselves!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible confrontation.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to face in the most engaging boxing match of up to 66.7 kg in the weight category of up to 66.7 kg met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in the ESPN office in Los Angeles in separate rooms, up to Garcia, the lightweightweight Champion of the Undefeated World Boxing Council, walked across the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the badgeweight champion of the World Boxing Organization.
After the victory over the former Quadruple World Champion Adrien Broner on Saturday in Showtime, both fighters belong to the top five of the weight rankings.
Garcia reached her right hand and said, "How are you doing, champion?
I wish you luck.
Lomachenko protects her belt with Miguel Marria on Saturday evening at 19:00 at ESPN.
When the couple posed for the photos, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible confrontation between the fighters would be "perfect measurement."
"I'm still in the weight of merchandise," Garcia recalled.
"I moved up to Bourer for Bourer, but I'm not that big.
I'm 66.5 kg a small.
I want to move down the lightweight.
And he has to move upwards with the lightweight [61,2 kg], and then we can fight.
Fans have wanted this.
Let us offer them this.
Lomachenko has agreed.
"The world of boxing needs this fight."
The question of whether it should be paid to view it, which is part of his strategy, according to which he wants to debut Lomachenkol towards the end of this year in a class of 61,2 kg to make a possible meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) for the next summer, who is also interested in fighting the winner of the Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell match after their light weight title rally Forum on 23 September.
"Finding this fight could be paid, as fans have wanted this confrontation," Garcia said later, saying that he is open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
"We are the main players.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they're ready..."
Garcia said she thinks Lomachenko's "amuring fighter" and could go see her Saturday match.
Lomachenko, on the other hand, was modest in approving Garcia, saying that she thought the champion of the three divisions from Riverside "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted this knockout."
According to Garcia, the goal was to show the strength of the impact and then boxing.
Both confirmed that they feel the tension to increase in the power between them.
"This is a fight that awaits realization.
No other confrontation will cause so much attention and buzz.
I'm more than willing to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I have been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey is exactly that.
It's gonna be a good fight.
Which corners of the world are moved to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) extended and issued a record residence permit for citizens of third countries who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work, study or to a family.
For example, last year it was decided to issue a temporary residence permit to 6702 aliens, then the number of tuna bubbles was 4928.
The authorities cannot tell how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia permanently, but such an analysis will be prepared in the Ministry of the Interior.
While nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia ten years ago, in recent years this number is beginning to reach close to 2000.
The number of applicants for residence permits increased exponentially during the crisis in Ukraine - in 2014 1087 people received a temporary residence permit, 675 a year earlier.
According to Statistics Estonia, the number of Ukrainian citizens is increasing the most in Estonia - 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia last year than left.
"The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia and due to difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many family already," said Kristin Rammus, spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior.
Last year and tuna bubbles, the number of Ukrainians who received a temporary residence permit was higher than even the number of Russian citizens, although the last of the last two years have received the most temporary residence permits.
While the Ukrainians come here mostly to work, Russian citizens are about the pererände.
"Considering the historical Russian community here, they are more likely to have even the biggest family ties with people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, migration researcher at the Estonian Academy of Security Sciences.
"If you look at where Russian citizens who have been granted a residence permit in Estonia have moved to live, then after Harju County is immediately Ida-Viru County," he added and pointed out that about 40 percent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Last year, 1696 Russian citizens received a temporary residence permit, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wanted to extend the residence permit decreased.
"Hüpe is due to the fact that a new residence permit has been applied for permanently in Estonia instead of extending the residence permit," explained Rammus, spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained rather stable for years.
In order to permanently enter Estonia, aliens who have lived here for at least three years can apply for a new residence permit from last year.
Its purpose is to encourage the stay of the adapted people here.
However, the residence permit of a long-term resident requires, for example, five years.
The extension of the old residence permit has probably also decreased because of the new residence permit.
For example, last year, 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years were granted such a residence permit.
Now Ukrainians can change jobs and the Estonian state no longer fingered whether the salary criterion is met.
This residence permit became popular - last year, the owners of the grey passport (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
In total, 1968 people received a residence permit for the purpose of moving to Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In ten years, Nigeria has surprisingly become a country whose citizens are one of the most active applicants for the Estonian residence permit.
In 2007, three residence permits were issued to Nigerians, then 200 last year.
From Nigeria, they come to the universities here to study.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turks.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen mostly because of student migration.
In the case of them, too, there is a rule that where the community has emerged, there will be more easier there," Rammus added.
Over the course of ten years, two people have also moved to Estonia from North Korea, the same amount from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If about 6,000 third-country nationals receive a residence permit per year, it is about 0.46 per cent of the total population.
Even if you think more citizens of the European Union, migration will remain at about a percentage," Maasing commented that the figures are actually small.
According to Statistics Estonia, 14,822 people migrated to Estonia last year, while 13 792 out of here.
This means that immigration exceeded emigration for the second year.
Most of the outside and inflighters are Estonian citizens, but there are more of them among the leavers.
Therefore, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was minus 2000 people last year.
Estonians travel primarily between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture's princess hustle charms with sats, embroidery and tulle
However, the bottomless style of ideas has history for Maria Tammeoru - old paintings and costumes: "I may have dream of a museum somewhere in the museum and admire the old-fashioned sleeves and collars.
If you do something with passion, you'll study it and learn about it every day.
It's a joy of discovery!
The glamorous world of Mammu Couture may seem to some strangers of life, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide how much radiance you have in your life!
I have a friend with a whole sauna full of my laude couture dresses.
Because it's not his fault that he doesn't live in Hollywood and doesn't go on a red carpet every day, he also wants to wear the most beautiful dresses and wears!
You can live your own life special!
The fashion artist does not recognise the gap between bright events and the grey everyday life.
It was this reasoning that planned to take the high fashion to countryside in Estonia, between forests and fields, to people who are often not in the power to do so.
Mammu's collection was presented, for example, in Võru, Jõhvi and Pärnu fashion fair, where the royal fillet with 45 models filled the whole street.
In Tallinn, the posture is often nodded with dignity, but elsewhere there are more emotions - Bravos shout, get up, want to thank you by hand.
A large part of the audience came to look at it, but now they're Mammu Couture fans.
If you exceed people's expectations, they're impressed!
And I like the feeling that I'm on a summer tour with my fashion design.
In Pärnu, we had a 50-metre red carpet full of beautiful dresses, it seemed that they would not even end!
Maria also does not recognise that the creation must be presented to the supersale supermodel, she will be happy to bring ordinary women to the stage.
Often I invite my own clients to the stage - they have always come with pleasure.
It's such a great experience, you can shine on stage in a beautiful dress!
I'm so sorry I've never seen my own show, I'm always behind the stage to give the last touch on things as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerve wouldn't let me take a calm look at the hall.
Maria is the kind of fashion designer who wants not only to play the representative role, but to be in everything.
I have my sewing machine in the studio, most of the collection.
I like the whole process where you play with the details, discovering.
I'm never far from my creation, and I'm not afraid of work.
The design is not limited to stylistics, logistics, organisation, organisation - everything has to fit the day of a temperamental woman.
I guess the hours of work come to the fanatics really like.
I can't even tell when my work day ends, for me, it's just a day full of joy!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an incessant chain of luck: I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and in turn compliments.
It has been said many times that there is magic in my dresses - they make themselves feel like a princess.
The plentiful satsi lines that made Maria's talent famous overnight have remained the signature of Mammu Couture to this day.
Martin Müürsepp about the boys: the Estonian subgroup tournament gun was now turned against us
Too bad, it's gone to fairy tale.
The first thing I noticed is that we didn't get our table.
And when there is such a big difference at the table, there is nothing to do," commented Martin Müürsepp, assistant coach of BC Kalev/Cramo, commented on the loss of 61:75 Estonian basketball boys in the U18 basketball boys to Great Britain.
The opponents took 28 balls from the attack table and therefore received so much more attacks.
We weren't ready for their aggressive defense or attack, it hit.
Many English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we couldn't build defense.
In the defense, however, they managed to keep their hands everywhere, we couldn't combine.
It knocked the team out.
The homework of the opponents was better done.
According to Müürsepp, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to take down the momentum of the opponents in the bud.
In the last quarter - we had zero mistakes, but the opponents have already received several quick baskets.
Attehyness and intense insistence, which was our weapon in the subgroup tournament, all turned against us now.
Today we had no strength against their aggression.
The mason was satisfied with his ward in Kalev, Matthias Tassi.
In general, good words can be said about the whole team, to this day they were a uniform punch fist.
It is a pity that such an aggressive opponent has been met before.
The cup has always been confident and played out today, but it seemed that he was tired - he had suffered quite a burden.
But he made some pretty moves I've seen in practice before," added the tutor.
Horrible numbers: the maid basketball team scored less than 10 points in the EM tournament in three quarters...
The basketball tournament of the B-division of young men EM in Tallinn does not only go to the U18 age group, the girls started the day before yesterday in Dublin.
And unfortunately, the Estonian game with Poland tended to the field of antirecords.
Estonia lost at 25:65, but after the third quarter the position was 9:49, i.e. only in the last ten minutes the opponents took the foot from the accelerator pedal and the period remained tied at 16:16.
In both the first and second quarters, Estonia scored 4, the third in...
At first, the Estonians hit two out of the first four shots in two minutes, but then 25 pieces past the game, then one three in and then 21 more shots...
Maybe in almost half an hour of 47 shots were captured.
In addition, 2 points out of four free throws came.
The ball losses were reasonable in this period, 12.
By the end of the game, the hit of Poland was 33 per cent and Estonia 13 per cent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses, on the opening day Portugal had to be recognised as a superiority of 83:56.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to replenish supplies
Today, the 1st permanent mine defence group of NATO arrived in Tallinn for the weekend on a scheduled port visit to complement the ships' reserves and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit, ships prepare for return to sea and give crew members the opportunity to rest for a couple of days.
After the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters in order to carry out several exercises and be ready for future search operations for the search for historical explosives.
"The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and their co-operation training in local waters clearly illustrates our integration with the allied forces," said Captain Arto Reinmaa, Commander of the Operation and Planning Department in the commander of the naval fleet.
As of 29 June, Commander Gvido Laudups, a Latvian naval defence group, will be led by Commander Gvido Laudups, who, at a ceremony held in Riga, took over the duties of the group leader from Estonian naval officers, Captain Johan-Elias Seljamaa.
The flagship of the group is the Latvian naval support vessel LVNS Virsaitis, which also operates the group's Steering Board.
This half-year the international unit also includes the Estonian naval mine hunter Sakala.
One of the four groups of ships under the NATO Marine Command is the NATO 1st permanent mine defence group is a readiness unit belonging to the primary rapid responders, which the alliance can be sent to different parts of the world within five days.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of Pirita Monastery will once again become a place where the Birgitta Festival, which was launched by Maestro Eri Klas 13 years ago, is considered to be held.
According to Risto Joost (36), the artistic director of Tallinn Philharmonic, the Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: The film "Traviata" and "Tosca," ballet performances of the enchanting "Bolero" fun "Bolero" will reach the listeners, nor will the performance of the programme, which this time the performance of Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratorio "The Ages" by the same international creative team, who brought Pirital to the stage in Haydn's second masterpiece "Loomine."
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre productions.
It's bigger than any musical theater in its usual form.
It's a festival that the enchantment of takes over and never lets go again.
For the experience that the listener receives in this sublime and mysterious environment makes the human souls ring and touches human perceptions in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you're the artistic director of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't Maestro Eri Klas's shoes look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, it's been a lot of help.
He directed me through my entire career in my career of study and also supported me at the beginning of his business.
Maybe that's why it's easier for me to continue his work.
Eri Klas has injected the Birgitta Festival team with so much goodness and, of course, it all is transferred to me.
It was great to join a team who knows exactly how things work.
It was the great heart of Eri Klas that gave me the strength to move forward with the Birgitta Festival in Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am, and I'll be fine!
What could excite the audience at this year's festival, what do you offer special?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, by the way, the first ballet written for Astrid Lindgren's story will be presented.
That's what "Karlsson flies."
And one of the curiositys about the fact that the author of this ballet is Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed his wish to write this work.
He probably has been living in Karlsson's character since he was a child.
Risto, how do you get all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner, I'm sure.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and luckily I have a heap of it.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions do not depend so much on other people as I do for myself, i.e. how do I meet every new day.
And keeping such a conscious tone, keeping positivity and actually smiling in the mirror for myself in the morning, significantly raised my lucky percentage.
Especially now this week, when the most important samples are, I have practiced it particularly eagerly and it works.
smiling itself activates the brain and increases tone.
It's not just a jingle.
I don't think people know half the things about their body, which the universe offers them, but everyone himself discovers it slowly.
Now, it's a big time.
Do you have a ritual before you step into the conductor's remote?
What the hell, clothes need to be replaced for more comfortable.
This is the little moment for yourself.
But in general, yes, I don't have a chance to rest before a big performance or take a little nap.
In fact, I even like to communicate actively with people, even before the conductor board step.
But come to the Birgitta Festival, here's something to discover not very big friends of opera and ballet!
Watch the spirited video with Risto Joost!
New results of the Swedish asylum-seekers" age assessment tests were published
In Sweden, a test was carried out among asylum seekers, during which their age was assessed medically with a novel approach.The latest results of the test show that more than 80 percent of the testitute was judged older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute for Forensic Medicine (Räts mõistusdativeverket) started tests towards the beginning of this year.
The tests were created to assess age more accurately during the application for asylum after the Swedish Integrated Citizenship Office (Migrverationsket) was criticised for not being able to correctly determine the age of several refugees of minors.
By now, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases to the testing, and the Institute of Forensic Medicine has issued a total of 2481 test results from mid-March 2017 to 31 July.
Eighty per cent (2002) was assessed at the age of 18 or older, and in 25 other cases the Institute of Forensic Medicine assessed that "may be 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, it was concluded that a person is "presumably younger than 18."
Tests are used only if the age of a person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson, who is working at the Institute for Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent compared to those of previous months.
"We do not see a major difference compared to the statistics of previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he said to The Local.
The fact that a large part of the cases were assessed older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
In May, the Institute issued 581 test results and said that 442 cases "there are indications that the person being studied is 18 years old or older."
But when Svenska Dagbladet studied the results of their 581 tests, it turned out that in 243 cases, a person had claimed directly that he would receive 18 this year.
This method of medical age assessment, during which x-rays of wisdom teeth and from the knee joints MRT are carried out, after which they are allowed to be analysed by dentists and radiologists, have been criticised in some districts.
One of the septics is Claude Marcus, endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, whose duties include an assessment of the biological maturity of people to find out whether they passed puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the measurement method currently used should be used.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we cannot say for sure, we should not pretend we can," he told Metro.
But Johan Göransson from the Institute of Forensic Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "It can be said in general that the risk of an unequivocal adultisation of the child is low.
The biggest, i.e. at about 10%, is the risk if the person is a little less than 18.

The 20-year-old hammer thrower Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut at the London World Cup, taking the 18th place with 67.37.
The organ was the youngest female hammer thrower of the MM, and a cheerful woman confirmed that she hopes to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and got a good experience.
In the first attempt (64.80), I immediately did my average result, in the second (62.80) I risked too much, and in the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear," Orel said after the competition.
I was looking for my throws, and I'm very glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orel's MM debut ended with a good 18th place.
Rainfall organ was not disturbed, as he trains at the stadium of Tallinn through TUT.
"I'm tempered," he said with a little smile.
At the London Olympic Stadium, there was almost a full house of people, did Orel perceived people around him or was able to turn himself off?
I did, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it adds - that's it!

I'm taking a good experience with me, and some days I want to compete for medals.
West-Virgina Governor announces party exchange
Jim Justice, the West Virginia Democrat Governor, announced at a meeting on Thursday evening with President Trump that he was changing parties.
"This or not, the democrats walked away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I say to you, having prayed and thought a lot... today I say to you, the Viginates, that I cannot help you as a democratic governor anymore."
The gathering was fired by cheerleaders.
"So I will be a Republican tomorrow," Reined Justice added.
"As a coach, I would say that it's time to play another game."
Trump had previously promised a great announcement at the West Virginia gathering.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia and Justice did not support the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and the coal business inherited from his father.
Its value is about USD 1.59 billion.
At the same time, the National Registrar (RNC) announced a statement on Thursday evening that "the exchange of the party of the Kremlin of Justice is another blow to a democratic party, which would prevent the country from being improved again than working for it."
"From all the 15 governors and control of the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is simply the most recent rejection of the party that has been guided from the beginning to the end and is unable to find a positive and unifying message," said Ronna McDaniel, Chairman of the RNC, in a statement to CBS News.
It's probably no surprise that where there's a lot of people, there's a lot of injured.
Urmet, who was in office in a week-track in a medical tent yesterday, told the Evening Newspaper that they had to share quite a lot of Bands out of the Band-Aid.
The blisters and abrasions are the main, twisting out and slight falls.
Of course, also head, back and foot pains.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival with the wrong shoes and so the problems come.
Medics have also had to help visitors with a couple of major injuries - there have been some panic attacks and also a one fracture of the legs.
We have also made sews when a person has broken a hand or finger.
We'll do the smaller stitches here, we'll send the bigger to the hospital.
Watch the video to see if the festive medics ask for analgesics for the treatment of hangover.
Coe praised the Russians' honest apology for the doping scandal
According to his words, Sebastian Coe, the international leader of athletics, praised "Russian Thursday's honest apology" for the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the time to allow the country back to sports.
Dmitry Shylakakhtin, the nose of Russian athletics, said at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that the ban on his country is correct and he has a definite goal of fighting doping.
He apologized "all athletes who have been deprived of gold and silver medals in competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of the ban on the competition imposed in November 2015, after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I think today it was a very honest presentation, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to journalists.
"The Health Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Sub-Union itself admitted that they had quite difficult times and they would do everything possible to reorganise the sub-Union."
According to Coe, he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its reinstatement.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is taking place, but the Congress supports the proposal of the working group that this is not the right time to withdraw Russia," Coe said.
"We must do everything possible in the next few months to normalize the situation.
We have always proceeded from the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from the damaged system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict IAAF criteria compete as neutral athletes at the World Athletics Championships in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, Head of the IAAF Working Group, said on Monday that Russia did not yet meet several restoration criteria.
Following a report to the IAAF Council, he told journalists in London that doping checks are still inadequate and that the coaches who have been banned are still working freely.
The revolution of electric cars significantly changes the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only does the revolution of electric cars significantly change everything from the fuel market to infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers on the metal market.
Although mining giants like Glencore can say that from one place they win and lose from the other, smaller mining companies will not help.
At present, Glencore earns from coal and coal, but in the future, in the era of electric cars, the demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel will grow.
This year, the decisions of the governments of the United Kingdom, France and Norway have increased their contributions to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades.
Therefore, Volvo has already known that they are planning to abandon the combustion engine and Tesla will launch a cheaper Model 3 electric car.
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecasts, electric cars are already sold for two decades than cars using oil-derived fuels.
"This changes everything about some metals," said Simona Gambranini Bloomberg, raw material analyst at Capital Economics.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, the demand of which has increased for years.
There are about three times more copper in electric cars than in a regular car, Glencore said.
Even more copper is needed at charging stations, which is why, according to Exane BNP Paribas, it will increase copper demand by about five per cent by 2025.
The increase in demand for batteries in electric cars means additional lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese demand.
Glencore gets the growing electric car trend from the rise in copper prices and the Jefferies Group predicted the world's largest cobalt producer.
According to this brokerage company, the winners of the triumph of electric cars are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market reacts to the already changing trend.
This year, the cobalt on the London Metal Exchange has increased by 70 per cent.
Last year's price increase was 37 per cent.
Copper has also increased by 14 per cent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore's stock rose by 20 percent in London, having crossed rivals from the price increase by Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo American.
On the losers side, lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine have a new era.
Lead main end use is the batteries supplying power of petrol and diesel cars.
Electric cars use lithium-ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand, unless it is found for another purpose to overcome the fall in demand," said Michael Widmer, analyst of the Bank of Merrill Lynch's Metal Market.
The effect of the anti-paced trend is not yet noticeable in the form of a price movement.
Lead has increased by 17 per cent this year, with the best metal from the price increase among the main industrial metals in London.
Investors will only see problems for metals far away in the future.
"I am not sure that this is so bad for lead, because cheap oil keeps regular cars competitive," said Herwig Schmidt, Sales Manager of Metal Broker Company Triland Metals.
When the lead demand falls, it happens slowly.
Maybe it'll happen in about ten years.
In the meantime, however, stricter emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars is increasing, which depends on advanced lead-based batteries when launching frequent engines, is assessed by the international lead and zinc research organisation.
Light metals like aluminum replace steel, as a lighter car can drive less electricity further.
This explains the additional 1.6 million tonnes of aluminous demand from 2013 to 2016.
This represents 2.7 percent of the world's total production of aluminium.
This trend is likely to get worse, Widmer said.
Aluminum has increased by 13 per cent this year, as the increasing demand by car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
Steel producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding works with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce tiny car bodywork.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe also try to develop a lighter alloy steel to resist the alumina mutinium.
"The stronger steel should be the answer to this development," said Sylvain Brunet, analyst of Exane BNP Paribas.
There is some progress in Europe.
The end of the oil age can also bring suffering to platinum.
Last year, about half of this precious metal was spent as catalysts for diesel cars, reported by metallic Raifiner Johnson Matthey.
"Many currently high-demand raw materials such as oil and platinum may not be in high demand in the future," said Bernard Dahdah, a raw material analyst at Natixis.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important, but their importance will change within 15 years.
Plate manufacturers believe in continuing demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Marc Grynberg, head of Uncore, said that in 2025 more hybrid cars are still being sold than full electric cars.
The great hope of platinum manufacturers in the 10-year run is hydrogen-based cars developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos, which depend on platinum to produce hydrogen electricity.
So far, however, this technology has not yet commercially justified itself.
"The guy seems to have a clear loser on his way to electric cars," said Exane BNP Paribasist Brunet.
German car manufacturers received a major setback in July, as the Stuttgart Court forbade the use of diesel in the home town of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How football finance rules affect Neymar's transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unbridled spending of European football clubs do not hinder Neymar's world record transition from the Spanish football club to Paris-Saint Germain, France.
Any consequences from UEFA, the governing body that rules the European game and which has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament, Paris is still waiting for Saint-Germain.
The financial rules for the fair game (FFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must at some point prove that the Neymar switchover was financed without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million (USD 262 million) solely for the Brazilian to buy out of his contract, and Neymar's salary will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's French club.
PSG will undoubtedly be able to pay out such money to recruit Neymar and to add its starry lineup, given that the team is financed by the Qatar energy richer family.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot on recruiting players, but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to come out of the football business.
FFP was founded by Michel Platin after being elected President of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that fall into high debts in search of success are actually cheating and risk ruining if banks or owners should give up support.
Since 2011, FFP has focused on monitoring their losses instead of the debts of clubs.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used in Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and then make high costs to improve the team and create a global brand - is more difficult to implement.
During the current three-year valuation period of FFP, which lasts until 2018, clubs can bear losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the disastrous disgracefulness of Plalin's office in 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferin, his successor of UEFA, is still committed to preventing excessive spending.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules in the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is the FFP supervisor in UEFA, to The Associated Press last week.
According to Neymar, Neymar's profit or loss by the State account is contingencing the NGA's restructuring plan for the purposes of the sale of Neymar.
Neymar concluded a five-year contract and it is therefore possible to show the transitional fee over the next five years in the form of an amount of EUR 44,4 million per year.
On the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the PSG, together with Manchester City, belonging to Abu Dhabi, received the most severe punishments on the neck.
PSG was fined a fine of EUR 60 million (at that is currently 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and the club was required to restrict the Champions League team to be restricted to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players in the 2014-2015 season.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to outwit the regulatory financial institutions by blowing up their income through companies affiliated with club owners.
Qatar's company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as an official income.
This happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of Qatar Tourism Authority PSG support was bloated.
It has been said that a certain part of the service of Neymar PSG may come from Qatar through payments from the 2022 World Championship Management Committee.
However, the PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become a World Cup ambassador and claim that UEFA regulatory authorities could easily expose such a manoeuvre.
The punishments previously imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant due to any attempt to ignore the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not proactively discussed Neymar's transition with the PSG.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition that their anonymity is ensured because they are not allowed to discuss the situation of the PSG.
The latest published reports show that in the 2015-2016 season, PSG made a profit of more than EUR 10 million in the turnover of approximately EUR 542.4 million.
The data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymar's arrival will have a good effect on sponsorship transactions, trade and shirt sale.
The club expects a minimum increase of 30% in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
Neymar tried to prevent the transition from the Spanish league, being clearly upset about the departure of one of the largest football stars, claiming that the PSG was thereby infringing FFP.
"This is a clear "financial doping" case with the club and the state," said Javier Tebas, President of La Liga, to the Spanish newspaper AS, PSG, mainly owned by Qatar.
Arsenal's manager Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares La Liga's attitude that the state is funding the club.
"This is the result of property rights and it has completely changed the entire football landscape over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the state, anything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play, as the state may have other ways or other interests to represent such a large player to represent the country."

Today 50 years ago: a storm of hurricane size in Estonia that tore roofs and windows from the houses.
The hurricane called the storm of the century, which raged on 6 and 7 August, caused major damage primarily to Läänemaa, Harju County and Raplamaa.
In northwestern Estonia, the wind speed was over 30 m/s during these days.
My old man ran from one curved tree in the garden to another and tried to support them with his hands.
Everything was blind and squabbled, like the end of the world.
At the background, the rooftops flew from the houses, recalled in 2002 the old lady Linda Kurova from Haapsalu in an interview with Eesti Loodus magazine.
Linda's husband saw the garden he planted collapse.
But what do you think of the trees with your hands where you get against a storm like this?
The sea came under the window, the water splashed in from the windows," said Mrs. Linda, who lived on Kalda Street in Haapsalu at the time.
Linda saw the fact that the roads were full of trees and the roof of the railway station had flown 20-30 metres away, Linda saw most of the haapsalus just the next morning.
According to locals, behind Paralepa the trees were down in the story, some were completely down, some were down in half.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm went through the beautiful old trees with ragina and cracks like war.
Lääne-Viru County could not suffer particularly severely compared to Western Estonia in August 1967, but the damage was large there, Virumaa Teataja wrote in 2007.
Haapsalu Castle Park and Padise Park were wiped out of the earth, but the parks in our area were also severely damaged.
In Tallinn, the wind speed was measured at up to 35 meters per second, i.e. about 130 kilometres per hour.
On the evening of 6 August, a little girl had shouted in Merivälja in Tallinn: "Mother, mother!
Chickens are in the air and can no longer be signed!" said Virumaa Teataja.
The Põlli manor building in Viljandi County was so destroyed during the storm that it was later decided to demolish it.
Augustitorm was not met by the constructions of Türi's ski jumping hill, which were no longer restored later.
The Red Täht newspaper wrote on August 12, 1967 that the harvesting of cities and settlements from fallen trees and their branches progress slowly, and the inhabitants could participate in the cleaning.
The crop fields were also severely damaged in the storm, and the newspaper announced that "parka's initial organisations must be inflicting as well as inspiring and guided by harvesting."
You can talk about hurricanes if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record of the outbreak wind in Estonia will remain from 2 November 1969, when Ruhnu measured the speed of the wind at 48 m/s.
The instrument of the Vaindloo on the island broke, so the speed of the strong wind measured there could not be exactly recorded.
The secret of clean bathing: night cleaning and poor beach weather
Cold summer weather also means a smaller cleaning sky on the cavities of Tallinn.
"If there is a weather, then people are on the beach, and if there are no people," says the beach cleaner.
On the Stroomi beach in Northern Tallinn, seagulls are screaming.
They are offered by a tractor that mocks the harrow on the patch stunts at low turn.
In fact, the latter sifts through the sand at a depth of seven centimetres, picking out the sea lining and the cross left behind by people: bottle corks, cigarette bones and more.
People are still coming to the beach, regardless of whether the water is warm or not.
If there is a beautiful weather, then there are people on the beach, and if there are no people," says Aleksandr Usov, the head of cleaning of the beach of Haabersti Haldus.
It's 6:30 p.m. and there's a bitter cleaning job on the beach, because at eight o'clock the site has to be in order for people.
Usov's on the job from 4:00.
Besides Stroomi, he also keeps an eye on the beach of Pirita, Lake Harku, Kakumäe and Paljasaare Pikakari.
The quantities of litters have decreased.
Years ago, there was a lot more.
People are now already able to appreciate what is being done for them," says Usov, who has been cleaning the beaches for 15 years.
Before it was the case that when something new was set up, it was broken the next day.
Now they're holding what's on the beach.
Price of clean beach
One of the biggest works on the beaches of Estonia is the cleaning of sea litter, i.e. a sea litter washed on the shore.
For example, on Pirita beach, it has to be transported away on the beach season of 400 000 tonnes.
"This is an incredible amount," says Usov.
Another large category is made up of household waste, i.e. everything people leave behind.
There are eight large garbage containers on the half-second-kilometre Stroomi beach stripe, which need to be emptied three times a week.
There's so much garbage.
However, colder summer weather has meant that the trash is one fifth less than otherwise.
The third species is formed by abandoned things.
Most of the time, they're children's dreams.
This time, Usov has shoveled a dozen model cars out of the sand.
They will wait for the owners on the wooden road leading to the beach.
"Typically, more of them come out, but this is a normal catch." The Faith already knows that soon he will find them in the sand again.
The kids come to the beach and take toys to drown them in the sand again.
The trash is being scattered.
Erika Scholler, representative of Haabersti's Administrative Services, admits that the screening of the tractor is disturbed by locals.
Noise, which lasts from hours of the night to early in the morning, interferes with the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
In the daytime, however, this work is impossible.
In one month, the beach has to be sifted twice.
"If we do not do so, the district will fine us," Scholler notes.
However, the goal is to get Stroomi beach under the international blue flag quality label, like Pirita, Pikakari and Pärnu.
"Compared to Europe, there is much more work to ensure that the beaches are maintained," Scholler says.
We have more seaweed and stones and harder to sift sand.
However, there is less rubbish on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
When he hears that rubbish is being discussed on the beach, Martin, living near Stroomi Beach, steps an unforced discussion circle of journalists and cleaning workers, highlighting the current bottlenecks of the beach.
There's a gross picture everywhere in the mornings.
The problem with birds and bottle pickers who have pulled garbage bags upside down," says Martin.
Although it is difficult to assume that people are able to change their behavioural habits so far, Martin hopes that the city government will do something with trash cans and put on them, for example, the covers, in order to prevent at least the birds going on there.
In general, however, Martin is satisfied with the development of Stroomi beach.
You can see the city's taking care of it.
With children's fields, illuminated and freshly asphalted teas, it has become more pleasant.
It was once the case that roller skates could only drive on one road," Martin notes.
Treasure finding in Stroomi: coins, coins only
The morning tides period has been used by 40-year-old Dimitri, who, as a treasure hunter, combs the coastline with a metal detector.
He doesn't think today or in the future he'll find anything valuable.
The gods of the sea are not generous enough.
"I've been dealing with it for a year and haven't found anything valuable so far," Dmitri says.
As a homosexual hunter, Dmitri's treasure bag has some euro coins, bottle caps and also dangerous nails that later throws into the trash can.
Usually there are coins.
"There are usually no rings and other such," says the treasure hunter.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to report that interest rates will remain at the former level, as unsuccessful economic growth and inflation relief have softened speculation due to an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sloppy, as the incomes from households have put interest rates on hold.
The policymakers of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted for maintaining 6:2 rates at 0.25%, and fewer members are demanding an increase this month, as slow economic growth has weakened its support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut the 2017 growth forecast to 1.7% and to its 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the pressure on household incomes remained, as inflation is still expected to rise close to 3% in the autumn.
At the same time, the bank also signalled that the increase in rates will be necessary to contain inflation from Brexit over the next few years and financial markets may require a higher increase in loan costs.
Members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the mammary package that stimulated the economy launched as a result of Brexit a year ago.
In February, the bank will end a fixed-term funding scheme that offers low-cost funding to the banks, although he said that now a GBP 15 billion larger offer is expected under this scheme, which is GBP 115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision taken in relation to the rate, the bank says: "The gross domestic product (GDP) will remain in force in the near future, as the difficult situation of household real income will continue to have an impact on consumption."
The rates were repeated that a "financial policy of tightening a little" was necessary to alleviate inflation, and the "somewhat greater" than the markets were expected.
The stock exchange is currently predicting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and the second rise in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any jumps are stepped and limited.
The bank's reduced growth forecasts for this purpose and for the following year are comparable to the May forecasts of 1,9% and 1,7%.
The forecast of the 1.8 per cent increase in 2018 remained.
After this news, the rate of the nail fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound dropped by 0.5% to USD 1.31 and by 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth indicators that have suppressed the growing hopes of an increase in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
The bank says that the growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it will start to gain a bit of momentum.
The bank's latest inflation report gave little reason to rejoice in households suffering from rising inflation and miserable wage rises, saying that the situation will get even worse before the improvement.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent a blow of income that hits income in the next few years, but wages are expected to recover significantly towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Due to the weak pound, the economy is also stimulated by the growing demand for British production, which partly compensates for lower consumer costs.
The decision will come a year after the rates were reduced by 0.25% in August after the shocking EU referendum, which caused the nail to a sudden weakening.
According to the Bank, it is likely to take four years to fully breathe life on prices and the economy.
Before the bank's last decision, there was an increasing demand for increasing the rate, as inflation had increased the pressure on households in tightness; in July, three policy-makers demanded a 0.5% increase.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although according to the bank, it was expected and there will be an increase in the coming months.
The bank said that the excessive increase compared to the 2% target was due to a completely weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Head of Coreco mortgage brokers, said: "Because of the recent decline in the exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market is again becoming more and more competitive, as lenders crave work and hope to end the year positively.
The stock exchange seems particularly favorable for those whose current transactions are about to come to an end, as refinancing, often without a service fee and low rate, has become increasingly popular."
NHS has caused a contradiction to 10,000 people in writing HIV
Patients have access to "transformative" HIV preventive treatment since September, after a battle held in the Supreme Court, whether NHS should finance the drug.
NHS England has now reported that national health care is now making an estimated 10,000 people available to 10,000 people in the initial three-year clinical trial, a tablet that is administered before intercourse and has shown a reduction in the risk of infection in high-risk people by around 86%.
NHS agreed to finance a clinical attempt after the Court of Appeal supported the Supreme Court's decision last year according to which NHS is able to pay for PrEP, despite the institution's own assertions that the drug should be financed by local governments instead.
Simon Stevens, the CEO of NHS England, welcomed this course published on Thursday as "new extensive intervention," while the AIDS National Fund (NAT) described it as a "turnal moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register people, and in October, more clinics are added before the program is introduced throughout England by April 2018.
Pre-Content Prevention (PrEP) is a course of HIV medicines that is taken before intercourse in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV among people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there are a sufficient number of certain drugs in the human body that prevent HIV infection.
Such medications may be taken every day or at the latest two hours before intercourse.
Candidates suitable for treatment include homosexual or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and do not receive treatment.
The clinics identify suitable people who agree to participate in a clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose partner with HIV cannot receive antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also receive their wish to register their participation in the local sexual health clinic participating in the programme.
The program costs GBP 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to receive medicines this week after the international tender procedure.
The purpose of the clinical test is to assess the actual potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on whom the drug is intended and how it is consumed and implemented in a large picture.
Stevens said: "This new extensive intervention should complement and amplify a wide-ranging and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is another milestone in the fight against one of the greatest health problems of mankind for more than three years."
Deborah Gold, CEO of NAT, said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if this is properly targeted at those who need it and belong to the risk group, offers the opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people with high HIV risk in England have access to a powerful new tool through this NHS-funded clinical test, which is individually manageable and does not depend on negotiations with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We welcome this announcement warmly.
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Fund, said: "Now it is essential to ensure that the clinical test is quickly pushed to the country and that no HIV risk group is excluded.
Now that the drug of the PrEP clinical test has been procured, we are on our way to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of being infected with HIV.
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Minister for Public Health, said: "The start of the clinical trial of the laser clinical trial is very welcome and severely delayed after months of delays and the drag of the government's feet.
Evidence shows how significant changes this medicine may bring to the end of the prevention of HIV and the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical test takes us one step closer to the full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical test is introduced across the country as soon as possible in order to protect people with exposure to HIV and to take us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society.
The price of electricity increased by 12% in Estonia, while in Latvia and Lithuania it decreased.
In July, the difference between the exchange price of electricity between the next day in Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania decreased to 1.94 euros, compared to 7.71 euros in June this year, Elering said.
The main reason for the price difference is the failures of the Lithuanian-Swedish connection.
In Estonia, the average exchange price of electricity last month was 34.33 euros per megawatt-hour and the price increased by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price decreased by five per cent to 36.27 euros per megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was 34.17 euros and the system price of the Nord Pool electricity exchange was EUR 26.37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices increased by 12 and seven per cent, respectively.
Electricity between Estonia and Finland moved to 75% of the hours of the previous month towards Estonia and 16 per cent of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine per cent of the hours between the two countries did not take place the next day.
Electricity between Estonia and Latvia moved from Estonia to Latvia for 99 per cent of the time and 73 per cent of the hours were in use of all transmission capacity.
According to the transactions on the last trading day in July, the price of electricity on the Nasdaq OMX market may be approximately 34 euros in August and 37 euros per megawatt-hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide affecting the price of electricity increased last month and the transactions took place at a price of 5.04-5.47 euros per tonne.
Living high life - half-floor and smart design tips have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate innovator, exchanged his big home in Knightsbridge in 2014 for Earls Court's apartment.
It is located on the ground floor of Queen Anne Terrace and the fact that Joanne has not packed her bags and resold the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
"Before I lived with my former partner in Knightsbridge on a much larger surface," Joanne said.
"I was looking for something that would be the same for the price I offer.
They showed me that Earls Court apartment, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day.
Since the first visit, this 93-square-metre apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
At first, it was an apartment with one bedroom and a complex layout - to reach the bedroom, it was necessary to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a semi-floor to take advantage of the high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
These were my demands," he said.
He hired Duck & Shed, an architecture and design studio operating at Assead Notting Hill, to take advantage of 3.8 m high ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two rooms on top of each other, so it was architectural challenge to create a semi-floor where you could stand up.
Erfan had to approach it creatively.
"The mechanical construction is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to reorganise the rooms so that they are located on top of each other without having to bend down.
It was not just the construction of the platform, but used a steel structure so that both the height of the upper and lower space would be correct."
This position allowed Erfan to create two full-time rooms in the room with a lot of dramatic elements in the room.
From half to the floor, the old-fashioned Retrouvius window overlooks the glamorous living space below.
The golden furniture with a mirror surface, silver details and the retro-scented Serge Mouille luminaire accentuate the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of theatricality, space and brightness.
In both ends of the short corridor are attached to the mirrors to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the back wall with a mirror gives the impression of another window.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet offers a storage position for all Joanne cutlery and glassware.
The beauty of the living room is added by the opportunity to close the kitchen part if not used, creating an image from a more glamorous space.
The folding kitchens are nothing new.
However, there is a unique fact that it is a garage-type lifted door.
"It took a bit of a design silence," Erfan explains the door from the MDF veneered MDF with steel strength.
"It has a counterweight, which is why it glides very easily when it pushes up."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 extra square metres, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"After all, the floor space is what you sell - or what gives the real estate value," says Erfan.
"The estate agent steps into an outdated room and makes calculations based on the area of the floor."
Here they have been able to increase the floor space, while using high-quality materials that add luxuriousness to the room.
"The berries are what you touch and that help to make an emotional connection with the home," Erfan says.
"You don't fall in love with the electric cable in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make the heart tongues ring.
This shows that a good design and enlarged area help to make something amazing from a fairly ordinary apartment.
In fact, they may even create a desire not to leave, as happened with Joanne.
Dane Jensen, the protagonist, is a Chicago sky-breaking bounty hunter who competes with a colleague for his promotion.
Does not count other than the amount of money earned, next to which all ethics are forgotten.
The man only sees his wife and three children early and late in the evening.
In the first half of the film, I think it's a version of the business world of "Card House" - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's eloquent is similar.
The more the film goes on, the less the frame-housed element remains, and the moralizing intention of the filmmakers begins to appear more and more.
The protagonist's son's illness will be cancer for life-changing experience.
Now you have to make a choice between work and family life.
On walks in the office of architect, a son makes your father think of great buildings in Chicago on great buildings like faith, goodness, love..., not even a disaster of twin towers.
After the third scene, where the son opens his father's eyes, there is a feeling that the filmmakers have certainly proceeded from the goal of getting the audience to cry, because even the most colder heart the viewer cannot hold back tears in seeing the suffering of a cute boy who is a cancer patient.
When the son collapses and his situation almost hopeless seems hopeless, his father finally understands the morality of his work and does a good deed for an old man seeking the job.
Now I bet myself in my mind - if the film has a happy end, I will reward my insight after the film with coffee, if I am wrong, then the screenwriter can be praised for at least one surprise.
For a moment there's a doubt that I'm gonna lose coffee - when my husband calls Dane from the hospital and the man rushes slowly toward the hallway.
However, the son is wonderfully healed, and although his father has just lost his job, it proves to be positive, because now there is time to deal with the family.
I can feel good too - I can already predict the end of American drama quite well!
To tell you the truth, the film is well engineered, all the elements necessary for this do exist.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and morale beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I'm sure that movie will bring in well.
Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the President's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually handle it.
Then he'd be the first.
Politico writes that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information that President Trumpin, including the news, in the hope that it will keep the boss in a flatter water.
Here's a break from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Human Resources of the White House, met with high-ranking officials on her first working day, she pointed out a key problem at President Donald Trump's White House, which she planned to solve - getting bad information into the President's hands.
Kelly told the officials that the information had to move through her, either on paper or at meetings, because the President would make better decisions if she were given good information."
Kelly's diagnosis seems quite logical, but others have tried it, and they have failed to control Trump with her monitoring media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with television dates back decades, and even now that he is in the White House, his TV viewer habits have not disappeared.
"When candidate Trump was upset about an unfair media coverage, he should show that he was also honestly reflected in the publisheds affected," said former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg to Politico in February.
Politico Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "six former campaign staff says Trump's key to controlling Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption also steadily includes a praise song."
All right, all right.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habits have once been "controlled" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something that the rest of us do not know - Trump's tweets would have been even more ignited without these interventions.
We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't post.
When his assistants were able to save him from trouble a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to prevent Trump from creating constant controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which is competing with each other, people try to promote their own interests without exception, transmitting to Trump material that supports their worldviews, but may not always be reliable.
Politico, which reflects the whole course of the story, wrote about the tendency of advisors to feed the President with strategic questionable information to the President.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
"Current and former Trump subordinates say that Trump can react to the negative press, especially on information leaks with adverse effects, explosively, obsessive to the identification of their source.
This also happened at the end of February, when someone gave the President a colour of GotNews.com, a printed copy of the website GotNews.com, owned by the Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused Chief of Staff Officer Katie Walsh of being the White House "the source of several briefs."
It doesn't matter that Johnson is permanently blocked from Twitter due to mockery, or that he did not offer any specific evidence, or that he has also filed false accusations in the past and withdrawn them.
Trump read the article and began to ask the subordinates about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that Reince Priebus, the Chief of Human Resources at the time, and Rob Porter, Head of the White House Office "have tried to establish a system for managing and documenting Trump's documents."
How'd you do that?
Kelly tries to do exactly the same three months later.
Perhaps he will be a more efficient leader than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad to the capital do not obtain permission for an acquittal to perform.
There are many foreigners in the centre of Tallinn to make music.
Those with whom the Õhtuleht got to talk admitted that they were playing in the Old Town without the permission of the city government.
The first to find three street musicians near Viru gates, who had taken the same number of dogs with us.
It was clear that musicians with rast sins and split clothes were backpackers, who could use a shower.
Despite the appearance, the only woman of the company played a story on the accordion with a fun rhythm, while a man next to him was juggling with three balls and invited the passers-by closer.
The third man had sat next to one of them and smoked a twisted joint in peace of mind.
Their three dogs wouldn't let themselves be disturbed by the passing people.
Bob, who played the accordion with Noem and the balls, said that they make music about both fun and money on the streets.
The purpose of the company's performance was to collect ticket money on the evening of the same day on the evening of the same day.
The question of whether they asked the city for music in the Old Town shook Noem and Bob's head.
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we will never stay in one city for more than a day or two, and mostly promises for a month or something like that.
There is no point in paying for it," Bob explained.
When we got back to the Viru gates about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were at the musicians and drove them away.
The company moved with backpacks and dogs to touch his luck at the intersection of Viru Keskus.
Three Polish young men also performed on Viru Street, one of whom played violin, the other clarinet and the third had even brought the electronic piano along.
"We are here to entertain people to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living," explained Mivosh, a trio of pianist Mivosh.
According to Mivosh, they are aware that the city government must be authorised to perform.
"Naturally, we don't have it," he said, jokingly.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there is no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we go elsewhere, but we have to try," he added.
Eesti Pank purchased bonds for 149 million euros in the framework of the public sector asset purchase programme of the central banks of the euro area in July, and the central bank's bond portfolio increased to a total of 4.36 billion euros.
The central bank does not disclose more detailed information about purchases.
In previous responses to the interpellation of members of the Riigikogu, the President of the Estonian Bank, Hardo Hansson, has explained that the asset purchase programme of the Eurosystem central banks includes three different purchase programmes: covered bonds of the financial sector, ABS and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank buys bonds from the market in order to encourage investors who have sold bonds to invest money elsewhere.
Under the influence of purchases, the rate of return on lower-risk assets will decrease and will motivate investors to take higher risks.
As a rule, within the framework of the public bond purchase programme, each central bank purchases its national government bonds, and bonds from other countries are not purchased.
Since the Estonian state has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank makes so-called replacement purchases within the volume allocated to them.
Substitutions are also made by central banks in those countries where the offer of bonds corresponding to the purchase programme is limited.
According to Hansson, Eesti Pank generally buys bonds of European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Investment Bank bonds.
Eesti Pank has been buying bonds as of March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering's bonds were also purchased, but Eesti Pank will no longer buy Elering bonds as of June 2016.
On behalf of the central banks of the euro area, both Elering and Eesti Energia will buy their bonds from the central banks of the euro area from the Finnish central bank.
Travelers ignore the ditch and return to the "millionaire district"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands have again come into a fierce confrontation with determined travelers who have ignored the council dug into a ditch to regain the field away from their villas.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans on the field near Solihull Street, baptized as a wealthy "millionaire district."
They have returned with the army of horses, children and trucks after they were only kicked out in May, without being disturbed by a ditch dug by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found a weak spot in the guard, squeezing their vehicles from the leftless part of the left-out leg tents.
The Maruvic residents are cursed by the Solihull Council, saying that the council is "using the problem useless."
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday evening after their rejection from Bentley Heath, where they threw away with stones.
The council must be embarrassed to act because they are useless to deal with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were chased away, and now they're back.
There were more of them last night, probably even more today.
He added: "Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long restraining orders to protect their parks.
I live on streetbrook road, and I'm not happy to have to continue paying the council if the council can't even stop such a thing."
A local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said: "This is ridiculous, and we saw the last of these travelers left, and there is already a new offensive.
This time, the number has increased and even a horse has been seen ruminating in the grassland."
The representative of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware that there is an unacceptable campsite in a country near Streetsbrook Road, and we are working with the Solihull police, and we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible.
It is very helpful to obtain evidence if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This will help to create a picture of the situation for the court if we present the case to them.
Among others, the Weekend festival is visited by the Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, who is glad that real world top names have been brought to Estonia.
To the question of why the Weekend festival is so important for Estonians, Saar answers that it should be asked from all those who enjoy the festival in full in three days.
However, he admits that real players in their field have arrived in Pärnu.
"While looking at the level of the artists that have been brought to Estonia, that the absolute top names of this music genre are brought home - this often does not happen in our area," the Minister of Culture says.
What artists perform at the festival, however, Saart speak the most about?
I consider myself a relatively old person, and for old people like me, Armin van Buuren, who walked up last night, is definitely one of the most experienced artists.
According to his disc spinning, everyone has swirled our feet at some point," he says.
However, he still brings out a number of names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian players: starting with NO-P and they can be read in a whole row.
In reality, this concentration of well-known names is very high," he says.
Take a closer look at the evening newspaper video!
Audi renews up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the middle of criticism of car manufacturers
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said that it offers software upgrades to more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to the Chairman of BMW, the company believes that "there are smarter variants than driving restrictions," referring to European cities, including BMW home town Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would renew three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel engines.
No company described these actions as recalls.
European car manufacturers have been keen to promote the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of equipment to be installed to neutralise diesel vehicles is increasing for automotive companies, making it difficult to keep the prices of cars competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under an in-depth investigation, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of pampering powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repetition of Volkswagen errors, which remained silent about the use of so-called scam devices, which made it possible to adjust the emissions reading to the regulations during the car testing, but withdrawn in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been prosecuted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamic sub-composition of the Audi Motor Development Department was arrested in Germany.
Former President Zaccheo Giovanni Paamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be tried in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was pulled into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany, when the authorities accused the installation of the Audit system in order to evade the requirements of European exhaust gases, thereby expanding an investigation that had previously been focused on the United States.
The involvement of the Audi in the research can be a big blow to Volkswagen - the luxury luxury car manufacturer generates a disproportionately large part of Volkswagen's profits.
The European Union flags will be purchased for 20,000 euros in Estonian schools.
The Ministry of Education intends to buy the European Union flags for Estonian schools by 1 September to nominate the Presidency.
In total, 570 educational institutions receive 105x158 centimeters of the European Union flag.
Flags are intended for indoor display, they must also be carried out in high-quality printing technique indoors with a tunnel fastener, mediated by ERR's news portal.
The flag flag has the text: "Confirm to the Estonian schools to note the first presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of 570 flags is 20,000 euros at the price of the Ministry of Education, i.e. one flag will cost 35 euros.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes a growing danger situation in Mexico
The employees of the weekly Riodoce weekly newspaper usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in Sinaloa, which are sown by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But today they are gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own security.
They're told that it's important to change your routines.
Two senior writers will discuss which seems safer: whether to bring the children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the board at the top of the room: "the enemy," "neutral," "alergocers."
They ask reporters to provide names in each column - no evidence is needed, impressions and inner feeling are enough.
The public authorities or cartels are suspected of being paid by drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists - a whole list of bad guys who make it a threat to reflect the chaos in Mexico.
There is no break of the breath of violence, and the more bodies accumulate across the country, the majority of them are made up by journalists - According to the Committee of the Protection of Journalists, since the sworn in office of President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012, at least 2,589 journalists have been under state protection since the attacks and threats are under state protection, and during this year at least seven journalists have been killed in seven states.
The latter's deaths include their editor and source of inspiration, Javier Valdez Cardenas, co-founder of Riodoce.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence gives a profound feeling, although his presence can be perceived everywhere - a large picture of Valdez, which shows the middle finger, and two reporters in the 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts depicting his smiling eyelid face or characteristic panama hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death, reports discuss common trauma, their nightmares, their insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate Public Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 to deal with journalists cases, according to the Committee of the Protection of Journalists, only two cases have been held to court prosecution.
As with most of the annual drug trafficking and organised crime murders, the number of which reaches thousands, journalists are rarely brought to justice.
The Riodoce editorial office continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the data and justice of the murderers, Ibarra says the security meeting is of great use.
"It's very stupid to waste your time at this meeting," he says.
"As long as the reason is unknown, you mistrust everyone."
Valdez left Riodoce office in Culiacan, the state's capital, on the morning of May 15th.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before two men stopped his red Toyota Corolla, forced to leave the car and he was shot 12 times, which is expected because of the name of the newspaper, which means "the twelveth rivers."
The armed man drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it in the neighborhood.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumors are free in Culiacan.
However, only silence prevails mainly on Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and the United States of America in January, Sinaloa has been one of the most bloody battle fields in the country, as rivalist clicks are fighting for the execution of a power vacuum.
It doesn't matter that a person or even several shots on the streets of Sinaloa every day, or that the cemetery is crawling with a wealth of double drug king mausoleums, which are larger than the homes of many living.
Let us forget for a moment that the peacetime refers to only one cartel run by the seaside state with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce, knows enormous guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes facilitated the killing.
The first of these was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of the party of the warless cartel in February, competing with Guzman's sons.
This piece of writing may have angered sons - the suspect gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they reached the newspaper stalls.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country in the name of his own safety after the raid took place in the newspaper editorial boards that reflected the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always exist.
He worked for the Noroeste newspaper in 2003 as a veteran reporter when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50-dollar units.
Bojorquez said that Sinaloas "was impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem."
Over time, the newspaper gained recognition and sales and advertising with their courageous and fair coverage increased.
The reporters liked to publish vigorous studies without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication from which they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for its Latin American coverage.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award for Freedom of the Press (AKK) from his courage to follow the Mexican drug history everywhere it takes.
He frankly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said when accepting the AKK Award.
Last October, he told the TV channel in an interview with Rompeviento TV that drug trafficking was a way of life in Sinaloa.
"You have to embrace the task that comes with the office of journalists - another chance is to play fool.
I don't want to be asked what I did when I faced so many deaths or why I didn't tell you what was going on."
The Riodoce team longs for Valdez, a joker who cursed like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared embraces and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported his routine.
He was always wearing his hat.
He went from the office across the street to the El Guayabo bar and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if his routine love is fatal to him.
His death has also made them doubt how to do his job best and to survive.
"They don't like to mess with these women, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs.
"These things could not be touched," Bojorquez said.
The result is strong self-censorship and self-maintenance even in the best times.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay out of it.
According to Andres Villarreal, editor of Riodoce, the problem is that "the smell can be deceived... and that's how this thing happened with Javier."
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they do not apply to the toxic community of profitable smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In a room where Riodoce employees met security training, mobile phones were no longer allowed anymore; a few days before that it was revealed that only the spyware sold to governments had been used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists.
In front of the house, two police officers searched for relief from a 40-degree heat in the shade of a tree.
The government appointed them to guard the Riodoce office in a four-storey building in the Culiacan middle class neighborhood.
Some reporters contemplated half-witting whether these police officers belong to the 50 percent police officers whose governor himself has stamped unreliable.
It's been months since reporters have driven to the highlands of land where control is de facto in the hands of drug gangs.
Riodoce's publication this week discussed three main stories.
One of them was the murder of former boxing legend Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.
In addition, they had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were abducted from Culiacan, a blockaway in a quarter-on-host restaurant.
There was no official announcement of who was abducted or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows - the restaurant is the favourite place of both drug dealers and the authorities.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician who belongs to the Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP) in power, which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century.
Recently, several governors of the IRP have been accused of corruption in the context of cases with a wide coverage.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about the previous incidents in the same place, including how the son of Guzman, named after El Chapo, got away from the military rites.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have searched Valdez column to get information about the kidnapping from the best sources.
"We would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, who is a clog of a calf, whose cloneth body has earned him nickname El Flaco.
"Now all communication channels have been interrupted with our sources."
Valdez's office has received storage space for labels and stickers that protest against the murder of journalists, and the editorial staff have become something they could never expect - activists for the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and headed to the office of the local prosecutor the next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the west state of Michoatan three days after the murder of Valdez.
The body has been found, and according to the officials, it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists have become more vocal throughout the country and crave the phrase "SOS press" as an organized protest to sidewalks and buildings.
On this day, Commander Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to gather international support to put justice on his feet in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez met with the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and telling the truth about killing them.
After that, he asked him to move from the disclosure of the government's actions, worrying that his anger had influenced his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were "necessary" limited by organised crime, co-lawed state officials and indifferent society.
In his last book "Narcojoliculism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by the orders of politicians and security forces who are meth involved with organised crime.
Last year, the Media Monitoring Group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of the attacks of journalists to the police and state officials.
"In Mexico, you will die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez said.
The murders are obviously blood-sitter.
No one forgets about the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state in Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a letter that was probably signed by the cartel Los Zetas: "I am here for my reports."
Next to his decapitated head, the computer keyboard and headphones lied next to his headphones.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, for example, the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state in Chihuahua after the murder of their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue as El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after their director's murder in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke to the drug coat with the editorial "What do you want from us?" on the cover publicly.
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It's a nerve-racking decision.
It's hard to find a job in exile, and they still have to gamble the streets to avoid dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as probably happened with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in a Mexican apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz in 2015.
Those who stay put and continue to work must dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that reflecting the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico is on its way to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, when the latest number had already been locked, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and sipped beer when all the phones suddenly began to vibrate.
According to confirmed firefighting between rival gangs and security forces, Mazatlan, the resort town of the beachfront, had killed 19 people.
The war continued to escalate, as many of the messages left by cartels found in the region promised.
From the edge of the sidewalk, reporters put the news on the Riodoce website using the news mobile phone.
The front cover of the next day needed to be changed.
The sirens grazed by another firefighting area.
Bojorquez peeked at the guarded police to see if they're vigilant.
When they were afraid, they didn't show it at least.
Under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, on which his average finger can be seen throughout Sinaloa, was edited by the employees of Riodoce in his footsteps.
"How could you think about closing at all," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day that Javier was killed, asked the apprentice to send him to the streets to report?"
Dinosaur used a protective color to prevent enemies
At first glance, it seems like a shape, although quite frightening.
Scientists have now published the first findings in connection with the incredible rhino-sized creature discovered by the Canadian miner, which is so well preserved that experts have described it as "Mna Lisat of the disinfectors."
It is so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that the skin covered with his armored was reddish-brown and his past had been somewhat "crushed."
The report published in Current Biology described the being as "the best preserved armoredinosaurus ever found" and "one of the best dinosaur figure in the world."
Fossil is a new species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous era 110-112 million years ago.
Its unbelievably good preservation of scientists in the bog who describe it "truly significant."
According to National Geographic magazine, this food vegetarian is the best preserved of the type of fossil that has ever been found.
It was found on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when it mined Suncor Millenium's mine in Fort McMurray, near northern Albertas, Canada.
He hit something that didn't resemble the surrounding stone, and decided to look closely.
The discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Palace of Paleontology.
For the next six years, the animal was developed to dig out of a 2,00 (1100 kilos) plot of land.
After all this hard effort, the end result is now finally ready to bring it to the public.
"If you squint a little bit, you can almost believe that he sleeps," said Caleb Brown, researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is exhibited.
"It goes into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur legends - the Mona Lisana dinosaurs.
When studying his skin, the researchers found that this plant eater, although covered in armored and reminiscent of a walking tank, was likely to have a significant risk of meat-eating dinosaurs.
This dinosaur with a lot of armored used red and white protective color to hide from predators, and applied a shade technique called a counter-ophing and also used by many modern animals.
According to experts, this allowed the dinosaur to blend in better around the dinosaur and avoid enemies, as larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt him.
This 110 million-year-old nodosaur family creature first made the news in May and is now visited by Royal Tyrrell Palace Paleontology Museum.
Scientists have now studied the creature and named it after Mark Mitchell, the laboratory of the Markmitchelli Museum of Borealopelta, who belonged to a team that spent more than 7,000 hours on the pet to uncover the arduously demanding.
Thanks to the amazingly good preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the body of the body of the body of the armour.
They discovered a counter-ophment - a method of protection common in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the being was darker than the lower one.
Although opposing is widespread, the findings come as a surprise, as Borealopelta is much larger than the animals with opposing the eclipse of today.
This suggests that the dinosaur was actively hunted by other carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred to overshadow instead of confrontation as a survival tactic.
However, most animals using modern eclipse - e.g. deer, zebras or scaradillies - are much smaller and vulnerable as prey, suggesting that nodosaurus had to really work to survive.
"The vigorous hunting of a dinosaur covered with huge and many armored shows how dangerous the chalk age could have been predators from the dinosaurs," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of the armored organic compounds also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal to get clues about this life, including the preserved content of this intestine, to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river, thus reaching the sea with a flow of it, where he sank back ahead of the ocean floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and the rivers and oceans were likely to stretch farther inland than it is now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable, as it is completely covered with the preserved armored skin, while it has also remained three-dimensional, maintaining the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"As a result, today the animal looks almost the same as in the Cretaceous Age.
To reconstruct it, you do not have to use much imagination - it is just enough to squint the eyes and it seems that he is sleeping.
The Cretaceous Age was a time when huge carnivorous dinosaurs - teropoods flew on the Earth, molested on two legs.
While all their king Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could be hunted by some of its terrifying predecessors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a monster with 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and six tons.
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta washed up into the sea after death and mummant muddy.
The creature was discovered on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk, when it mined at the Millenium mine in Fort McMurray, in northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is best preserved in the world, including leather and scales, and it is a complete cone to the hips.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
Two 20 inches of squirrels invaded its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this plant eater covered armouredly adventured through the present Western Canada until the flooded river washed its outer sea.
But the substretive burial site of the dinosaur helped to preserve its scales in excellent detail.
The hardened remnants of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the mygilcomplete bowels along the genital skulls still cover the skin remnants.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic: "This degree of preservation is as rare as the lottery victory.
The more I look at it, the more unbelievable it feels.
The materialed skin reels still cover the mygilcomplete bowels on the animal's skull.
The right forefoot lies next to him and five toes are stretched upwards.
I'll be able to count the scales on his stables."
How did an activist find an answer to the question "Whose streets?"
On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was completely shocked.
Just the day after travelling to New York, it sat on the bed in a rented room via Airbnb, browsing on Facebook.
He got into a post of his former schoolmate.
It said, "The police just killed an 18-year-old youngster and he's still lying on the street."
He was confused as to why no one else had posted this information in his stream, which is why he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The user's posts were repeatedly shared on his timeline.
A rapper from St. Louis area transmitted real-time tweets to Michael Brown, unarmed an 18-year-old young man killed by a white cop in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"It's crazy," Ferrell thought of himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He put his phone away, but later saw tweets again in the evening, which announced this time the gathering of people at Canfield Drive.
Photos of the police tape and screaming people and the man who claimed to be Brown's father and kept the sign with the letter "Ferguson Police killed my unarmed son!"
He watched a live stream of live where the policeman stood in front of a protester group with a barking dog.
In the second video, another policeman pulled a gun and shouted, "I'm gonna kill you all... animals."
Ferrelli remembers how he caught himself up from his idea: "It's unusual."
"It's not the kind of murder we're used to and what we could call "
I felt the horror turd at the time.
I was angry and I cried.
He booked a return flight and travelled home the next day.
Having landed at 23 o'clock, he went to his father to pick up his six-year-old daughter and decided that they would drive Ferguson the next morning.
What happened with Ferrelli and Ferguson in the next three years is a central topic in the new documentary "Whose Streets?" ("Welle Streets?"), which will be premiered in cinemas on 11 August.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and toughness from the point of view of people who live in this community and who met the streets demanding answers.
When Ferrell and his daughter - who were wearing a floral dress and a suitable crown - drove to Ferguson, they spoke again about the topic they had repeatedly discussed before that morning - from black experiences and living conditions.
"Do you remember when I taught you how a black community had to fight for its rights?" he reminds me of asking himself.
"We're driving Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't not take him with me," Ferrell said later.
"What is happening now is... the culmination of what happened in the past.
He needs to know and see and grow in the middle of it.
He must learn about activism and organization, and at the same time to know the different layers of black experiences and living conditions, and what we have to do to be free and free ourselves.
Even if I manage to raise him so that he does not personally experience blatant racism, he is no different from another black girl.
I feel like I'd make a disservice to protect him from this world.
The first stop they made when Ferguson arrived was on the way to South Florissant - in a place above the road from the police station, which had become a certain kind of campsite, where the activists were waiting for news about a police officer Darren Wilson, who was never finally charged.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who made lunches.
They assembled the food bags and helped to share them with the protesters.
For Ferrelli, it slowly began to take the shape of a new type of activism.
"My activism changed completely after August 9th," he said, noting that when he was a student at the University of Louis, he was the president of the minority Nursing Association and focused on food justice and health-related inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It all just worked out.
Weeks later, during the evening demonstration, Ferrell met with the co-director of the film, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said that he and the film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what was happening.
The question arose in Ferrelli's head: "Are you trying to document what is happening or find a story that can be exploited?"
Such skepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white people - often white people - come to the community and try to profit from its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson was not heard and we wanted to do so differently."
Folayan had already been handcuffed by co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the region known for his activism in connection with the prisoners of death.
His involvement made the project appealing to Ferrelli and the other locals that the team watched after Brown's shooting for years.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or with us, but we will talk ourselves," Davis said.
"It was important for me how these people are depicted, because this is how I am depicted."
Although the goal was not to focus on Ferrelli's experience - it was to show that the movement was not a "running of the sauna, but about the community coming together," as Folayan said - he became the most open participant in the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrelli's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing at the first time he saw the finished film.
"But I realized that doing this work and humanizing black people must be accompanied by certain vulnerability."
Moreover, Ferrelli's story re-puzzles and puts the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the initiators of the three movements who invented the theme reference on social media after the murder of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager, are homosexual.
"The leading role of black homosexuals have generally maintained movement," Ferrell said, "and this is precisely because we have to fight on several fronts all the time.
Black homosexual women have to carry this whole load.
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is indeed kept alive by black women and many of them are black homosexual women."
At the same time, he argues that "it is not a type of equal opportunity creation thing" - Ferrelli was not chosen as the center of the film because of his identity.
"He was a person who blew up the right energy," he said.
"But it is not a coincidence that he was directly on the front line, because there is a lot at stake as a black homosexual woman living in such nodes.
His energy can be perceived through the screen.
At the same time, the news cameras have long disappeared from Ferguson, but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
The probation penalty imposed on Ferrelli for blocking the road during the demonstration will continue for another 2.5 years.
He describes the social policy atmosphere in the area he calls home simply a "deep threat."
Nevertheless, he still considers the mantra he has been eating in memory since he went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.
7 tricks to get over the hangover after the Weekend party
Some of the strongest sons of a man find a drink-filled party after a drink, what's wrong with it, it's also help.
Or proceed from the saying "exply hangover, stay drunk."
But it's just an inevitable postponement and a decent basing for health.
What can you do to get over yourself better in the morning and as pain in the hangover as possible after today and get over the hangover as possible?
Drink some water.
Down and after the alcohol, after a big party in the morning... or even instead of alcohol, if possible.
Since the body loses a lot of liquid when drinking alcohol, it needs to be recovered somehow.
Along with water, minerals are also washed out of the body and therefore it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often upset after the snack, it is especially good if it is bubble-free or only slightly carbonated.
Go for a walk.
I'm sure you shouldn't go to Grandma's hangover with a hangover - it could be a fatal false decision.
But a light walk helps the body to remind you again what it feels like to be alive.
Laying in a tent and sleeping out is a more time-consuming way of healing.
Give the body back gradually and carefully.
If you're already on a vomit from drinking from yesterday, you don't want to try to charge a big fat steak in the stomach.
For example, to start with fresh juice, which contains fruit sugars to quietly revive your body.
If health is already suffering from noon, then you could try broth, for example.
And a little later, the backyard.
Avoid the coffee.
This diuretic will free your body from every single water.
As has been said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you take analgesic to prevent a hangover in the evening, your liver must deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol and thus loses performance.
This way, you ruin your liver even more, and in the future, the hangovers will be worse.
Plus, the painkiller doesn't stay in the body for a long time anyway.
If you take an a painkiller in the morning, don't do it on an empty stomach - it irritates your already torn stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, get along with yourself.
Works about the same way as walking, but when walking, you can't have an orgasm.
However, avoid too active pace and crazy poses - during a hangover, physical exertion should be moderate.
You gotta be kidding me.
Talking to friends and co-insurviators, make simple stupidities and smile friendlyly over yourself and others (beatings).
Naly and laughter may not hang out, but it's definitely more fun with them to tolerate the aftermaths.
One day the hangovers will go over anyway!
Northwestern's professor and an employee of the University of Oxford are wanted for murder as suspects.
According to the police, a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford who have become suspects after finding the body of a deadly stab man from one Chicago luxury apartment, is being sought nationally.
According to Cook County's court documents, on Monday, an arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and Andrew Warren, 56-year-old, were issued on Monday for the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the documents, the 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated stabbing.
According to a warning issued to the community by the Chicago Police Department, the body was discovered on 27 July.
The police got a phone call and found a victim on Grand Plaza's apartment building, whose body had several puncture wounds.
According to officials, the Cornell-Duranle Award was declared dead at the scene of the scene, and the investigators deal with stabbing as a murder, while the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has been working as co-professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President Public Relations at the University, said in a statement sent as an e-mail that Lathem has now been temporarily removed from work and is forbidden to enter the campus of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal case competent to investigate the authorities, and Northwestern University is working with investigators," Cubbage said.
Warren is an older assistant at the finances department of Oxford.
A representative of the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and ready to help US research institutions in every possible way."
In addition, the statement stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted to give himself up.
Anthony Guglielmi, Head of Communications at the Chicago Police Department, urges the suspects to turn themselves in to the authorities.
"The police have an idea where they are, but we are increasingly dealing with the definition of the exact location," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities help to seek suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police received a phone call from the Grand Plaza apartment building manager, who had just received a cryptic tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
According to the police description, it was a hideous sight.
According to Guglielm, it is not clear whether the event itself also took place on 27 July.
He said the security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren's stay in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi added.
Grand Plaza's management sent a letter to the residents: "The police are currently working on the chronology of events and the victim's background and explores various motives, including the possibility that it was a family dispute."
Start-ups to help your business avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees in her e-commerce start-up, but the surveys were unprofitable.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
"This system simply was not consistent and objective," said Errett, who manages Madison Reed, an e-commerce company selling hair care products in San Francisco with 75 employees.
So he called for the help of external persons.
The astounding is the start-ups dealing with new types of human resources, which help companies find out what their employees know.
By developing and licenseing software, the specific purpose of which is to measure employee involvement, they allow companies to conduct sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and a hot route to submit complaints, and in some cases to allow language carriers to go past C-level managers and to contact the management board directly.
"Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit, which are intended to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO at the Redwood City start-up Glint, the software analytics tools of which companies use to measure employee engagement.
According to Errett, he has been given a much better overview of what his employees think and feel for three years during his three years when he has used Glint.
In addition to sudden research and surveys aimed at specific teams, it provides a company's heat card, which gives an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing him to identify the reasons.
Companies have begun to understand that they need to stay informed of their work culture in order not to become the next Uber, which has been wrapped in scandals since the former employee published a blog post that described the harassing environment where those who dared to speak were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, the desire to have an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
Global management, regulation and compliance may be worth more than 14.7 billion dollars by 2020 according to FinTech statistics Let's Talk Payments data.
Convercent, a start-up in Denver, Colorado, helping companies prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, observed an increase in Uber's dubious reputation this year in the background of Uber's dubious reputation.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered for a customer.
Like Glintki, Convercent companies lets companies send customized impulse surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and view heat maps from problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous messaging line that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when the CEO is concerned, the complaints go directly to the board.
"The public opinion has been given to the regulatory authorities," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
Quinlan said that if the company finds that the company treats its employees poorly or behaves unethically, the company could face serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, employee departure and cases, even if regulators do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees at 500 sites, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees" awareness of rules and procedures and provide an easy way to communicate with the corporate headquarters.
If the employee wanted to announce the problem earlier, he had to find the phone number or e-mail address of the corporation's headquarters, file a formal complaint and hoped that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a daunting and uncomfortable process, said James Vitrano, general advisor to Tuesday, who said that there was no good way to monitor employee complaints.
However, now that the company uses Convercent, problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices that did not previously reach managers operating in other cities or states offices are possible to identify and deal with them faster.
"I can get closer to the holistic 360-degree experience of employees," said Vitrano, who manages Ruby's risk management team.
"And we protect our shareholders for litigation with the employees."
Quinlan said that companies began to take ethical behaviour, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, i.e. after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations in connection with Enron's scandal.
But only when "social media became mature," the companies realised that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from being publicly washed online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service by taking periodic fees from companies for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors who have been supported by both start-ups.
Convercent was financed by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February, raising the capital collected by it to 47 million dollars.
Glinti invested 10 million dollars in Bessemer Venture Partners in November, increasing the company's total funding to 60 million dollars.
Such investments do not come as a surprise to take into account the interconnectedness of companies, culture and venture capital.
More and more studies show that modern workers expect more from the workplace than before.
Competitive markets such as Silicon Valley have high wages and interesting projects are merely contributions on the table.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy in the company, feel that they are listened to and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of the Generally Benchviary and Employee Experience Department, LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors earn income if companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are dedicated and involved.
If third-party analytics tools allow to increase the commitment and involvement of employees, then it is no wonder that they will find support.
According to experts in work culture, the possession of data on employee involvement is important.
But this data is useless if the company's supervisors do not do anything with them.
In fact, if a company asks its employees to receive feedback, it can create expectations that there are changes ahead.
And if the changes do not occur quickly enough or not at all, it can cause disappointment and reduce the involvement of employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 proposals, you must be ready for 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Kotter International, a consulting and business management company, who has seen how companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
"Because if things are not to be completed, the employees think, "Did you actually listen to me?
- Do you care?
And if you don't care, then why should I care?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who now conducts research among employees once a month, has been able to take measures on the same day as the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from employees disappointed in the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganise several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with the problems.
Ruby Tuesdays, however, collects new data on workers and hopes that in the long term it will lead to a long-term commitment of workers in an industry known for its high labour flow.
"If you are not committed to ensuring transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you lose clients.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies."
The bright star of the euro area is Baltikum: income is growing rapidly
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic countries are rapidly approaching the income of the rich Western European countries, Bloomberg writes referring to the report of the European Central Bank.
According to the central bank, since 1999 the total production of the economy per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
Success is due to a low debt burden, rapidly improving institutions and business and free market-friendly policies.
"The Baltic countries, together with Slovakia, are among the few countries in the euro area, where real-GDP per capita purchasing power has significantly approached the EU average," the central bank said.
Although the goal is that the total production of the economy per capita is equal to the richer Western Europe, in 2015 the total production of the Baltic economies per capita accounted for only 2/3 of the average of 15 countries that belonged to the European Union before the 2004 expansion round.
Low wages have led the Baltics to look for better wages from abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is also growing this year, local residents are not enthusiastic at all.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the inhabitants of Latvia and Lithuania assessed that their economies are doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, this was thought to be a little less than half of the people interviewed for the economies of their countries.
NCAA's decision to cancel workouts twice a day makes Bruins' days long
It's almost 23, when the UCLA footballers stop to chat at the edge of a new training ground on the team's campus.
Some of them have peeled off their shirts, revealing the sweaty back of the first day of their training camp.
For a large part of the team, these idle minutes offer a break from noon.
Players participating in summer courses go back to the dormitory to study for final exams after three hours of training before returning to Wasserman Football Centre for meetings the next morning at 6:30 p.m.
"The next three days will be a real challenge for them," said Bruins' coach Jim Mora shortly before Tuesday became Monday.
The NCAA decision to cancel the exercise of the players twice a day to reduce the load, has actually made their days longer - at least until the final examinations are reached on Friday.
For this reason, the first three trainings of UCLA were scheduled to start at 19.15 to fit into the already tight schedule of players.
The transition from two trainings per day means more days with one workout - the beginning of Bruins training camp was raised almost a week forward compared to last season, and for the first time during the six Mora Westwood seasons, training takes place during summer courses.
They have 18 training courses until 20 August before an official preparation for the opening match against Texas A&M in September begins.
According to Mora, he is in favour of NCAA's change of rule, although it adds another item on the agenda to the tight schedule of players.
"They have a huge burden on three or four days and this is a serious challenge," Mora said.
"And they break through this ordeal; they struggle; they are nice young.
I believe that when the Saturday arrives and we have more time, it's really nice."
When the camp is over, UCLA's training makes it closed, which is not an easy task at all, given the clear view of their squares from the nearby parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Centre, a higher-class hotel that has already been hit by footballs along the defence network surrounding the gatepost.
Since this weekend, the hotel Bruins players are occupied, but Mora admitted that problems with the rooms may arise during the season.
"Let's step security measures," Mora said.
"This is a real concern and it is not overexamination to think that people can rent a room and film training from there.
If you have a recording of training, you can make a pretty good deal with it.
But we'll use a security team there and the 8th parking lot.
We'll do our best to use the existing one.
I'm trying not to worry about that.
We have a plan in place.
The Savisaar-Ivanova Election Association, born to the Centre Party, Kristiina Ojuland, who was revived from the Reform Party, and Tegus Tallinn, a fountain of businessmen created by the unitation of the forces of Maria Kaljuste, created by the Reform Party, and Tegus Tallinn, seems to be held at least as many as political parties in the local elections this year as political parties.
However, chicks are considered in the autumn, and the key question will be whether there will be enough disappointed voters for them all.
Who stays with Savisaar?
If Edgar Savisaar's supporters have decreased small, he may imagine the events organised in honor of the election coalition.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and current central party members and many unknown faces - is this the composition of the election coalition?
And is it possible to find out the reason why some of Savisaar's faithful followers and friends from applying in Tallinn can be sought that the "Savisaar List" of the donors, led by corrupts and suspected of corruption crimes, is becoming a reality?
A music video filmed on the roof of the city government for Russian-language pop singing, in which the elder of the Lasnamäe district participates; and in every sense the basic computer game, in which the protagonist Prime Minister Jüri Ratas must avoid lomps and squirrels on the road when driving on the bike - does the Centre Party try for the first time the votes of voters aged 16 years and 17 allowed to be allowed to enter the ballot boxes?
We will wait for the perception of the youthful election campaign of other parties.
If the viewer of Channel 2 or TV3 is facing a black square instead of an entertainment show from the beginning of August, there are two options: agree that only ETV2, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and English France24 channels will be announced in the future or give up ten-week television operators every month.
There are probably also those who at first welcome the advertising-free television experience, but in the end - albeit reluctantly - pay for television and advertisements.
The devasive music, noisy people and junk left on the streets are unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you don't want to get a piece of fun, it's worth going home to discover your homeland instead of aching your head at home - and leave the sleeping place for a hefty amount for the largest amount.
Washington changes the rules of the green card
Media outlets are quoted by President Donald Trump, who says that a new U.S. immigration plan is planned, which changes the rules of the green card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants for 50,000 people per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions in connection with family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and the President supports them.
The Bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money, as it changes the way the US issues green cards to other citizens.
The law reduces chain migration and begins to replace the current programme.
The new application process gives an advantage to candidates who speak English and who have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that benefit our economy," Trump said, according to the United States media outlets.
Siberian Seto young people move to the city, pensioners back to the countryside.
Jevseveyev Anato continues the tradition of the famous Seto gold wells along the former Maana River.
He works as a chandelier by the gold terrace at the Maaana tribune tribune.
It's a tough job: 12 hours of work for two months in a row without rest days, and then only ten days at home and back again.
For three years worked in Artelli, Anatoly has seen gold only once.
"There is a hard time: when going in, it is thoroughly checked that the vodka does not bring it, and when going out, that the gold does not take with it," Anatoly says.
Mare Piho's conversation in Haida village with the local Seto Jaan, who has told him a lot about the memories of his family in Siberia.
The still preserved archaic culture of the Siberian Seto begins to affect home-set sneakers, because it is just so fabulous, Piho Mare considers the far far Setos studied in the most thoroughly.
It will be 30 years since his first study trip to Siberia this year.
During this time, he's been there 14 times and lived there for a year.
How many deposits did they travel to Siberia in the late 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century to get land here?
That's an unsolved question.
I'm saying that 8,000.
I figured it out according to Siberian Seto men's stories, who have thought about it.
It's hard to say, because there were up to 30 people in one group at the time, but the passport was only given to the man.
Passport was given only to one, but he had children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look how big this territory was here!
It was many times bigger than the historical Setomaa.
It had to be educated, managed in some way.
Setos came here as peasants, but their lives changed because here they got into areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (sclocking), gold mines, industry.
For example, in New Peter, many of the Seto later went to work in the sheltered city Krasnoyars-45 (you built the Soviet power plant - J. P.) when formed.
Did the Setos make up the majority of the population in this region at the time?
Yeah, they lived compactly.
In addition, the tradition of marrying and many sutures was preserved for a long time.
Seven-eight kids in the family were common.
How much of Siberian Setode culture differed and differs from that of the Seto of the Motherland?
They are different, although what was brought here was once the same one there.
They brought a lot of folk costumes.
They also did (people's clothing), but they always made a difference that had been brought along and what had been done here.
Climate change strongly affected the traditional clothing of the Seto, because it is colder here.
The food changed.
For example, in Setomaa, the meat was salted, but here they just frozen.
Where are the Siberian Seto villages and what life lives there? / graphics: Alari Paluots
The connection to the motherland was spiritually strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now this Setumaa is starting to give back there, starting to affect them.
Those girls who have lived in these families have listened to amazing stories.
Piho means the people of the Estonian Seto delegation, who came to Haida village in Noor at the beginning of July, and lived in homes - J. P. P.
What's in here is amazing.
"It is extremely easy to come to Tapa and go away, because the city has a great location: at the railway junction point and at the intersection of the roads," says Reigo Tamm, opera stable from Tapa.
The city is no longer just a military capital for a long time, we have a lot of nature, sports and cultural places and pizza can be obtained on any corner.
Tapa is the city of top-notch!
There is a small island on the Valgejõgi, running through the city, where tapasmen tend to have a Midsummer party.
"This beautiful place does not appear from the train window," Reigotes.
Those who are not afraid of cold water can swim in this river, because the river is full of springs.
I've been swimming there, I'm fine. I'm fine!
On the edge of the river, you can have a picnic and just make romance - you can look at the river and think ahead and behind life.
I've been there to walk with my girlfriends, too.
In addition to everything else, Tamm has been to the riverside to practice his ariad among the three bridges: "To ensure this place is by the side of the city, no one may meet if my stories are shying."
"There is a wonderful view of Tapa from the hill, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in winter and currently play disc golf course - the golf course has been made, discs can be rented from the sports centre," Reigo leads.
Old professionals go there with their discs, of course, but I haven't played there yet.
You probably have to invite my colleague Rasmus Kull to visit Tapa because he is an experienced disc golf player and has disks.
I think he's gonna lend me!
Reigo and Männikumägi were inseparable from the current time of the opera soloist's childhood.
At least during skiing hours.
There are many tears, disappointments and victories in my sport.
Not to mention broken sleds and skis.
"The whole city centre is currently full of construction work, all this changes beyond recognition," Reigo praises.
Tapa's old and tired station building is a very attractive place where summer discoveries are played.
I am glad that Märt Meos, the head of R.A.A.A.M. in 2012, took my idea and had to make a summer theatre with his theatre.
Although this year's theatre season "Aleksei Karenin" was just over, on August 11, there is "Ell betting" in the railway station when the old station building moves around the 1980s.
"On 13 August, Tapa is the days of the city, in the framework of which the open home cafes have been awakened in addition to the station building and there are a series of cultural events, including the folk race," says Reigo, who advises you to visit the city of 91 years in those days.
In a small yellow cottage on May 1, the museum has been in 1994.
"The house is small, but there are a lot of exhibits and a huge amount of information," Reigo praises the place, which is full of the history of the city of Tapa, most of which focuses on railway and military affairs.
Reigo smiles that when all the recommended places in Tapa go through, the stomach will be empty in the long run, but fortunately, the small town is full of cafes.
"We have such good restaurants and sometimes feel like you're abroad when sitting in cafes," he describes.
Educated and young soldiers in Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, so if sitting there is a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and in your hometown, but there is such an international company together.
I think it would be very exciting to listen to stories from the French or Americans.
Soldiers, yeah, we're moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The television channel bTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who announced that two Bulgarians were taken into custody for illegal camping in Greece.
On the morning of August 1, the police arrested a group of people illegally camped on the Sithonia peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but there's an investigation.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the television channel bTV that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free camping and are already imposing harsh fines on anyone who is caught by resting in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The checks continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
The wolves who teach puppies go to break sheep.
After a year's break, farmers of Hiiumaa have to give the wolves "learning material" to the wolves from their herds again - wolves who probably taught the puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, the wolves have broken sheep three times in Hiiu county, a total of 23 sheep and have injured eight, writes Hiiu Leht.
Last year, the corresponding number was only three, a year earlier 124.
In sync with the problems, the data of the Environmental Agency also show that wolf litters were not born in Hiiumaa last year and information from the Hiiumaa Hunting Council that two wolf nests have been fixed on the island this year.
On the night against Monday, the wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna in Emmaste parish and injured half of the 18 surviving sheep.
Early Wednesday morning, the wolves broke one sheep in the pasture of the village of Reheselja and severely injured the other, to whom the emergency was to be made.
Rules for the handling of genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft Act on Amendments to the Release into Environment of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOVS) and the Plant Protection Act.
The amendment to the Act waives the establishment of a separate database for the locations of both genetically modified (GM) arable crops and operators, for which a plant health register will be used in the future.
In addition, the obligation on the GM crop operator to have a prior agreement within the prescribed radius of the person dealing with a beekeeping is amended.
Although at present no genetically modified crops are grown in Estonia, we consider the existence of clear rules for coexistence of genetically modified and unmodified crops.
This is at least as long as it has not been decided to declare Estonian GMO-free," said Sigmar Suu, Head of the Plant Health Department of the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be purposeful and proportionate, take into account the costs and administrative burdens for both the private and public sectors," Suu added.
The Bill repeals the provisions related to the database of locations and handlers of GM crop and handling in GMOVS, establish the requirements for handling of GM crop and commencement of economic activities.
In particular, as regards the apiculture, the current obligation of the GM crop grower to inform the GM arable nature of the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before starting growing.
The Bill of the Act has been sent for approval to ministries.
All interested parties have the opportunity to examine it in the information system of drafts and, if they so wish, submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The planned changes mainly affect persons, beekeepers and the Agricultural Board operating in the field of plant production.
In the European Union, including Estonia, it is allowed to grow only one GM crop - maize MON 810.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in the cultivation of GM's crop.
The reason is the circumstances that there is no corn pest in Estonia, a European blender, against which the maize line MON 810 is resistant.
Also, the varieties of this corn line have been bred for southern regions, and in May it is not suitable for our climatic conditions.
In order to obtain certainty, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has ordered studies in the seeds of various varieties of summer rape, corn and soy variety grown in Estonia in order to detect possible pollution with GM organisms in 2015.
The results of the analysis of the samples carried out showed that the seeds did not contain foreign genes and as a result of the survey it was concluded that the seeds of rapes, corn and soy varietys grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded that genetically modified crops are consciously not cultivated in Estonia and it was also confirmed that there has been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruited a "genius" in Nemanja Maticu's form
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has recruited a "three" in Nemanja Maticu's form, after midfielder Sampdoria made his debut on Wednesday night.
A player overweight of 40 million dollars from Chelsea started 2-1 wins on Tuesday against Real Madrid in Dublin, United, in Dublin, in the final row, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on attack trips.
But after losing Blues' preseason Asian tour, Maticul was in desperate trouble about a lack of a match form and lasted only 45 minutes, and according to Mourinho, it has to be improved from a certain before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, a brilliant way of thinking - he has a football mindset," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get the form as soon as possible."
Like Matic, the new recruited Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the starting lineup at Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho began to set up his eleven starting men by the beginning of the season.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho still wishes to recruit three footballers, but he confirmed that the club had already done "excellent work," concluding contracts with three of his four priority choices.
"I am grateful to the club that they were able to realize three out of four," he added.
"I'm even happier if they can make four out of four, but they've worked hard for me."
Another grocer son got on the foot on the GSM transceiver on 1 August and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, a birdwatcher living in Sõrv, the first storkson was equipped with a escort in Sõrve, and this litter is already flying around, has left the nest patch and joined a large collection of sleepouts.
This is because Sõrvee does not have a grain field, writes the Voice of Saarte.
This Tuesday, it was relatively late to ring the cranes, another stork got attached to the transmitter, on the island of Muhu.
According to Martinson, the installation of escorts is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a stork son named Mati GSM was supplied with a custodian in Sõrv.
"His activities on the Internet are all viewable: how he went to winter in Spain, coming back on the German and Polish border for a long time and then came to Saaremaa," Martinson said.
The British inventor had a microchip installed in his body to get into the house and car with a hand-taking.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to install a microchip so that he could only open his front door with a hand gesture, get into the office and even start a car.
The 33-year-old Steven Northam had a tiny chip between his thumb and index finger and now offers this service through its BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to make their life easier with technology.
He has joined forces with the consultant-anesteshicologist Dr. Geoff Watson, a royal hospital in Hampshire, in Winchester, to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
The technology resembles a microchip mounted on cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam's company also replaces the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, asking for 300 pounds for one lock.
This father of a married child has now installed technology both at home and in his car BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House exhibit cost taxpayers thousands
According to the military documents published to TIME magazine, the White House decided to fly a naval helicopter to the south yard for the event celebrating American production last month to pay as many as 24 000 dollars to the entrepreneurs in the south yard.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, called Marine One on board the President, was the central attraction of the American construction programmes in the White House on July 17th.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and the highest officials of the White House examined industrial products from all 50 states during their tour.
The helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited together with a yacht from Maine, a Wisconsin fire truck and a forklift made in Mississippi.
According to the documents of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House War Cabinet requested a partial order of the helicopter presence, i.e. FARGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the southern yard for the "unsuspecting" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because it is an unusually large-gratecing event," said HMX-1's commander the day before the event in the e-mail to his boss, deputy naval officer in the field of aviation.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive in the south yard at 7 p.m. on the morning of July 17th at 15.00 and would remain there until the yard was cleaned between 6 p.m. and 21 p.m. the evening.
The fact that if leaving the White House were to be delayed, a second crew would need a second crew to return due to the restrictions on duty time.
The initial flight crew was at the helicopter during the event and the squadron's security team remained close to the aircraft throughout its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to read out from the documents given to the magazine TIME whether the second crew finally needed or not.
Hatch's law prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 investigated whether this event could violate this provision.
"We asked if it violated the Hasch law, and we were told that we wouldn't violate it," wrote the Commander.
"It seems that you have no choice," said the deputy commanding officer.
The White House declared the event "made in America" an official event, and the Hatchi law would not have covered it.
But even at official events, there are political undertones.
At the event, the President supported the efforts of the health reform that was discussed in the Senate at the time and praised the efforts to keep the government's regulations in place.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically lucrative purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely for a photo session is unusual.
Trump was focused in February when the President's plane rolled on the background at his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is swarming with messages that complain about how his predecessor used the president's plane.
"The light House is very pleased with the display "made in America," where products from all 50 states made by American workers made of American materials were represented," said Lindsay Walters, acting spokesperson of the White House.
HMX-1 teams often audition around Washington and in the south yard to practice the display at the White House of the United States with a centimetre accuracy.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 held 58 rehearsals in the courtyard of the White House.
According to the official, the flight to the event "made in America" was included in the monthly standard for study flights at the time of the month.
The squadron helicopters flew for an additional 11 hours for "non-affiliated support missions" that day.
According to the White House, no other exhibit of this event burdened the taxpayer's wallet.
According to Sikorsky's representative, the company was not involved in organising the exhibition of the helicopter in the south yard.
HMX-1 does not maintain the budget documents of the President's flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact costs of the event.
But according to the hourly prices of the Ministry of Defence for the financial year 2017, the compensation rate of the VH-3D is USD 24 380 per flight hour.
The Squader's records marked the length of the flight from the naval Quantico airport in both directions for 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using a helicopter is well below its amount.
"The calculation of the costs of the taxpayers on the basis of the estimated compensation rates is very misleading," Walters said.
"These estimated compensation rates shall include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible expenditure to be taken into account for annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 RAND study, the compensation rates of the Ministry of Defence do not include personnel costs, but they cover the costs of fuel, maintenance and contracts.
Sean Spicer, a former spokesman of the White House, defended the use of the helicopter at the event at the time.
"The point of the time is to show things made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are probably hundreds, if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe, just like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked hard on.
So, of course, it's right to highlight it."
It is not clear whether Trump was in contact with a helicopter or not when taking a tour within the south yard as part of the event, but he sat behind the wheel of the fire truck.
In the White House, Trump turned to the representatives of Sikorsky, making fun of the company's products in his personal aircraft park.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of their products."
Grit Sheadeiko - through tears, peace and joy came
At the 2011 World Cup, Sheadeco hit the last area, a foot cramp in the 800 m race and the girl was taken away from the stadium with a stretcher.
Immediately before that, he had received zero in the long jump on the universe held in China.
The 2012 Helsinki EM was ruined by an injury in cheapness, but at the Helsinki Debut Olympics held in London, he won 23rd place with 6013 points.
The misfortune, however, continued.
After the opening day at the 2013 Moscow World Cup, the Estonian woman on the schedule of the Estonian record on the schedule received a gypsy injury.
Two years later, he took 15th place at the Beijing World Cup and fulfilled the Olympic standard, but this had also wanted more disappointment for the athlete.
Sheadeiko only passed the hardest gauntlet last year, when she did not receive a result in the long jump at Amsterdam EM at first.
I'd just like to put together a proper multi-competition once.
Once," confessed the gesture.
The worst was still ahead: a month later, his Olympic competition in Rio was interrupted already on the first barrier due to thigh injury.
Time had to be taken off - is it even to continue the 7th competition?
Is the two-day effort still worth all this?
She thought for a long time, but he found peace.
I got my head to clean.
It is relatively difficult to describe this experience, but I have thought that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Luckily, there was time to heal yourself and think clean.
"I knew I wouldn't put the instruments in the bag yet," Sheadeiko said about my self-cleaning.
I got to turn the clean page and move on with a new momentum.
According to Coach Anne Mägi, it was very difficult to look at the suffering of the ward, but she realised that the athlete himself had to find out first and foremost.
He was so buried by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
"Grit said, however, that he would not give up and he wants to prove to himself what he is worth," Mägi says.
Now there's some kind of peace in him.
He's doing it for his pleasure.
The competition came back in May, when Sheadeiko set a new Estonian record in the multi-competition of Götzis 6280 points.
In a high-level competition, he improved his personal top brand with nearly a metre (13.89) and ran in the obstacle race close to the record time.
Then the multi-competitor sensed that it was not at all a ceiling of powers, but only the first competition hunger was erased.
Mägi, who instructed him for years, says that Sheadeiko is a pattern student.
He's a ready-made athlete. He's good to train.
If something does a problem or wrong, he'll say it now.
He knows his body and trusts his perception.
That's what we have to do.
I can't say exactly what needs to be done and we follow it.
Sheadeiko has also found a new approach.
"I am not the one who makes the maximum in practice," he says and says that the most important thing is to get the right feeling, because it also ensures a good result.
The happiness of the close baby makes you happy
Good emotions have also been offered to the gesture's happiness.
Both his former training companion Maris Mägi and her sister Grete recently became parents, and the multi-competitor has received support from new weather citizens.
"It has been very interesting," says Sheadeiko.
One of the alcohols that are like brain training.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big wine fan that she believes - the brain can be used better with wine than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
According to him, it is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but instead in the "very active" process of tasteing wine.
By sniffing the glass, spinning wine in the mouth, enjoying it and sensing the aftertaste, we put our brain to work to create a taste for the wine.
According to the license, wine molecules actually do not contain a taste, but taste arises from the way the wine stimulates the brain.
He brings how the brain "see" the colors.
"The taste is not in wine, the taste creates a wine tavern," Sheperd says.
For example, the things that affect the emergence of the wine taste are, for example, our age, gender and even the amount of saliva that a person produces.
Of course, the license says the wine isn't to get drunk.
"There must be more in action," he says.
If you take too many sips, the system will be oversaturated.
Excessive wine drinking can harm the brain instead of profit - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine, memory loss, balance and reduced mental capabilities risk.
10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive less pay from colleagues
The data of Fontes, a staffing company, reveal that 10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive less wages than colleagues.
The ten-percent pay gap is between men and women, writes the portal Genius.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the salary survey of the Fontes ICT sector.
In total, there were under 8 577 positions.
63% of the posts worked with men.
"Although only 3 companies stated that the pay gap is in favour of men and there is no pay gap in the opinion of the rest of the companies, in reality, the basic salary of the men's month is on average 10% higher than that of women and the total salary of men per year is on average 8% higher than that of women," said Fontese analyst Ilmar Põhjala.

The third season of "Narcos" will be kicked off on September 1st.
According to the UN, Afghans democracy depends on the role of women in politics
The head of the UN mission to Afghanistan said on Wednesday that the elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, Head of UN Assistance Mission, said that hundreds of women stand for the local council elections, three women stand as Vice President and more than 30 per cent of the voters who have recently registered are women.
"It is not possible to exaggerate the importance of the role of women," he said in a statement made on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the election process.
The elections and presidential elections of the local councils in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban has, for its part, threatened the election process, which coincides with the transitional period when the role of international military operations becomes advolhensible.
This year's elections mark for the first time when power is peacefully handed over from one democratic elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, the strong role of women in democracy in Afghanistan is increasing.
According to the independent Afghan Electoral Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million voters have registered.
The joy of sharing makes everything more cool for both large and small.
There is always too little time in common, but the exercise with bluffs gives a good opportunity to combine being together, game, closeness and load.
And what a convenient solution - wherever you cruises in the summer, you'll always have a living ileus with you and remind you of your thin voices impatiently: "Let's work out!"
Start with warm-up - a regular hawk game or flagting along the beach strip is very good.
The scow is the foundation of standing in the form of legs and buttocks - who would like to take the shape of a sand cake washed from the waves during the summer?
It's a miracle to use children instead of a lever!
First of all, it is safe and comfortable, the weight gradually grows at the same pace as the power of the trainer.
The advanced one can also squat with quite large children.

Larger children can squat themselves at the same time.
The extent of movement is set by stretching the earth and reaching the hands.
Keep your fingers straight, ask the ministabbing to hold on properly.
The child can read repetitions and feel like a coach.
Plank is a super-interest, but for the child hopelessly boring exercise.
But it's easy to make it more fun!
Game-plank: Take a long plank colon to get through in turn.
More difficult than usual, but more fun to do than you can give a friend a hand in the meantime.
To add a load, you can last phease, a small back, and walk around this position.
For extra weight, you can put a smaller child on your hips, but this exercise offers fun for all children.
While crabs on the sand sibang, triceps, buttocks and abs get a load like a nail.
The child descends on the legs so that his weight is equally distributed in front and back.
You can hold hands for security.
Bend your feet and stretch straight up.
The baby can fly, have fun, train balance and be hard.
The life of a little coach is extra fun when he gets a little kiss every coming up.
Extra load is given by stretching your feet forward.
Check that the back remains in neutral position.
Children themselves have a lot more fun to make abs in pairs and clap.
Hand-job and pulsed squat.
Keep the baby safe, knee position, and hold the spine in a neutral position.
A favorite and great fun for all children!
For older people, while truly effective throughout the body exercise.

A wide world from Philippines, a shoulder-to-mouth trip to the heart of fashion fans
Beer-braked bags are summer classics, which have become a hit product on its own in recent years, which one of the right summerers even has to hang on his hand and on which merchants have been able to weld an appropriate price tag for the hit despite its modest origin.
The beer-woven bag is probably one of the things that have existed once in their lives and the possession of which has not caused special emotions.
It just exists, and if it's not, nothing's broken.
Now, however, straw bags are making a real triumph, and fashion fans have changed their fine designer bags for the summer months for simple straw braided bags.
At the same time, it is not only a beach bag, but today it is just as popular as a street bag, and braver women even walk into the office with it.
However, it is worth making it clear first of all whether such a summer look is still sitting for the boss or whether it is worth putting a maid and the laptop is still pushed into a slightly more official miku miku.
However, the richness of mediation has made women a real summer love from straw bags.
For example, when reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing that fashion gourbands are the first thing to bring fashion gourmets to the local market as the first thing to do and buy a few shoulders bag, which then the whole time of the holiday is faithful and which comes with the beach, the market and girlfriends also hang out on the city.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy a larger pile of bags from the market and sell or give them to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting that the demand for bags among readers is so high that in the real world, women (and men!) would probably go on each other by hand to become the happy owner of some bags.
In some ways, such madness is also understandable, because rarely are the times when it is possible to buy a few things in the fashion world for themselves in a hit-by-day job for just a few dozen euros.
True, clever merchants have also discovered a simple way of getting money here, and so finer luxury brands also sell straw bags for a few hundred and thousands of euros.
Probably so that the richest customers don't have to feel like simple mortals who are promenaded with some cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy a straw bag of over a thousand euros in Dolce & Gabbana.
However, Chanel's straw bag interpretation can be paid around 6,000 euros.
Unlike most fashion hits, the straw bags do not come from some great fashion fairs at all, but their story began from a farther away.
Namely, the shoulder bags allegedly date from afar from the Philippines, where they have entered the wide world.
The braiding of the shoulder bag is there first and foremost, and the locals do not even often see them going around.
Supposedly, the burning shock comes from the 14th century and is quite similar to ordinary basket puking.
However, since the straw bag does not have to be braided as strongly as the basket, they can be embedded in the patterns and other materials that make the bag more personal and acreotile.
For example, lately there are particularly trendy bags with coloured ribbons or leather strips.
The letter of thanks can first and foremost send straw bags to actress Jane Birkin, the biggest braided straw bagge fan of whom had never been seen before.
Namely, he matched the straw sack to all sorts of clothing sets and did not consider it much to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
Today, however, the popularity of bags does not play a smaller role, but also that taking care of them is a rooster head, and unlike all other sumadans, they do not have to be maintained with special means, but also water and wet towels do not do it.
As always with trendy eating, brands have come up with all sorts of interpretations since the classic appearance.
For example, you can buy a liner from straw or a tiny shoulder bag.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that the classic straw bag never goes out of fashion, but  straw shreds.
But what's the classic strawbag?
For centuries, a bag of straws has been considered classic, which resembles a basket from its style, is open and has been short, as well as straw, Sanks.

GMB is worried about investments in McVitie's Glasgow factory
The trade union expects managers from managers of the cookie manufacturer McVitie's approval of long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has remained silent about the future of the Tollcross object investment.
The factory, where Hobnobs and Rich Tea produce cookies and other products, more than 500 people work.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie's, said that they had invested more than 5 million pounds in the last few years of the object.
There were employees more than the employees, and the boarding fathers "there are the first to hear" when something changes in the factory's activities.
In a letter sent to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland approached the company McVitie with a request "to settle concerns about the fact that funding is not used to modernise production lines."
Drew Duffy, Senior Organizer of GMB, said: "The fact that we do not get clarity from the main manager of the object on Tollcross's business needs and the future investment plan, makes our members deeply concerned.
Several generations of families have worked here, and the workforce consists largely of the local community and the people around the Glasgow region, being an indispensable pillar for proper employment in an area where there is high unemployment and social deprivation prevails.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and well-being in the eastern part of Glasgow, and against the backdrop of Brexit, the increase in living costs and the chronic decline in production, McVitie's company is inquisitively.
The representative of Pladis said: "Tollcross's site manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company responds directly to him as we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
A regular meeting between the employees and GMB representatives took place two months ago, where a number of problems were discussed openly.
We then discussed with the workers that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and precarious economic climate, we will look at our activities on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all our companies and objects - to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years, we have invested more than GBP 5 million in Tollcross's object, most of which have gone into production lines and improvement of operations.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcross as a site of production, and if there are any changes in the site's activities, workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear from it.
Did PSG warned Barcelona about Neymar's approach three years ago?
La Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up in his quest to attract Neymar to his ranks by offering GBP 189 million to buy him out, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago for this record conquest trip?
This gossip approach has opened the summer transition window and Ligue 1 club is ready to crush more than double the current world record of oversold, which was set last season with Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United for GBP 89 million.
Once the transition has been completed, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and also the highest paid professional athlete in the world, who will receive a salary of over 500,000 pounds per week after payment from the PSG.
Barcelona is known to be angry due to both the approach and the complimentary breach of Neymar, although a source close to the board of Catalans confirms that the club has always taken the best of the footballer since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did the President of the PSG warned the football world about such an opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in concluding a contract with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif harshly warned all clubs that think about recruiting some of the best players in the PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we'll answer them and contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to make a deal with one of our players, they have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this border, as the Spanish club showed interest in PSG's central field player Marco Verratt earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave under any condition and that Barcelona could be rebound as a result of this interest, losing one of its expensive assets in the form of Neymar.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexit, not borders.
"Brexit is seriously threatening to swing between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland," Varadkar warned on his first visit to Northern Ireland after its inauguration in June.
"I can't imagine who's gonna benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made the current free movement of people and goods possible, Varadkar said.
"This is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not borders," he stressed.
According to Varadkar, he would prefer Britain to remain part of the European Union, and since it cannot be, it would remain part of the European single market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to streamline the liberalisation of Great Britain would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, explained the Irish Prime Minister.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "We could definitely have such kind of Great Britain."
An alternative would be to return to customs points that would proclaim historical division and political failure.
"Get into trade, prosperity and peace," said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit a "program of our generation" and warned that its result could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's daily lives.
The Irish Prime Minister met in Belfast visiting the main leaders of Northern Ireland.
Märt Avandi, who passed his first half-long triathlon: Ironman can go through anyone.
Today, the largest triathlon festival in the Baltics was held in the winter capital Otepää, when about a thousand triathletes from over thirty countries were held in the semi-long Ironman competition.
The 700.3 miles long distance consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km cycling and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, Märt Avandi also finished his first triathlon victoriously.
"I thought it would be difficult and in the end it was complicated," Avandi said in the finish line.
Despite the complexity of Avandi, he stated that the triathlon is actually feasible for almost everyone.
"No distance kills, but kills the pace," he said, suggesting that almost everyone reaches the finish line at a reasonable pace.
Except Ott Sepp: "Oti's physical bodywork is fine, but unfortunately he does not know how to swim."
Avandi had eagerly worked out since February.
At first, 4-5 hours a week, later ten hours a week.
With 05:34:12 he won 270th place overall.
Although Avandi lost to Raio Piiroja (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen Ligi (time 05:06:37), he defeated other so-called "prominers" class.
Tanel Padar, who was a "good example" last year, lost to Avand in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (time 06:31:53 and 06:45:18, respectively).
The overall winner of the Otepää stage's calculation of the Ironman stage was Johannes Moldan with time 3:58:27, and the best Estonians was Ivo Suur with 04:14:09.
Among the women, the Dane Helle Frederiksen triumphed with 04:24:01, while the Estonians married Maria Rabbit, who lost to Frederiksen in nearly half an hour and became 04:58:58.
The opening passed a 1.9 km swimming distance in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water in 410th position.
