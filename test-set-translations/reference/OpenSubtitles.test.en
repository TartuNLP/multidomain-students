-Are you sure it was meant for them?
I'll give you $50 and a new bicycle.
We are never leaving. Never!
OK, bub, you ready to go?
I've graduated from the university. I'm very intelligent. I have a very rich inner life.
I don't know this guy.
I put my request in an absurd way.
Oh, for frak sakes.
Who knows, it could be fun.
That's why on his side, the current is mild.
How do you know about that?
It would have been, if we hadn't let the sauce clot.

I'm not scared for now.
I smell a garden.
You know, I'm gonna really enjoy this.
These humanitarian runs, man.
What's up with the kitchen thing?
I'm gonna find out what's on the other side of that door.
I need some advice.
If it was a power play, no one saw it coming.
